I have never had a leak with a real Whirlpool filter.<br /><br />One problem I had this last time, which others have had, is that after the initial purge of 3 gallons, after a short while the water would start to trickle and then stop. Nothing. I read about air in the line, so I followed the instructions of dispensing water for 5 seconds, then waiting again for another 5 seconds before resuming, and repeating countless times. What a pain! But it continued to have the problem. After a few dispenses, the water would stop flowing.  I found that if I removed the filter and snapped it back in, it would work for a few times, but the water not coming from the dispenser would just keep on coming back, until it hardly worked at all.<br /><br />I figured there was air in the FILTER. So, I washed the exterior well, and then submerged it in a deep container full of water (I washed it so that any dirt or contamination would enter the filter). Sure enough, I could see air very slowly popping out of one of the two opening. A small bubble, then pop, then another, then another.  I left it submerged for several hours until I was sure that I saw no more bubbles (I would also occasionally agitate it to help the air escape).  I then reinstalled it, and it has worked flawlessly ever since.<br /><br />So, if you have the same problem, that would be my suggestion.<br /><br />UPDATE: This worked for a good while, and then the same issue.

This fridge was crazy expensive, so I baby it. I got it at a huge discount ($750 off normal price) and I'll never be able to afford to replace it.  That said, I am REALLY careful about everything with it.<br /><br />Because of the nature of the water where I live, I know that the filter will have to be replaced A LOT more often than in areas without the problems of this area.  So I am careful to always check the indicator light inside the fridge.  But in approximately 6 months, it never came on!! That really bothered me.  So I started researching online.  I found sites and forums where people had had similar questions (apparently, this is a thing?) and did not know when they should change the filter.  The most useful advice I found was that you know the filter needs changing when the flow from the water-in-the-door isn't as fast as it was in the beginning.  I had not even noticed this because the reduction in flow had been so gradual.  So I changed the filter and the difference was immediately noticeable.  So, now I have put this filter on subscription and now I will replace it every time a new one is delivered.  Problem solved.<br /><br />The reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the relationship between the filter and the functionality of the fridge is not clearly explained by either provider -- not Whirlpool (the manufacturer of the fridge) nor by the manufacturer of the filter. Nothing is explained about what causes the light to come on or when it is suitable to change the filter.  And I don't know whose responsibility this ought to be.

When testing the large undersink and this refrigerator filtered water they are both consistently 100 PPM.  The reason I keep buying them is because at times when our water is worse, these filters keep the PPM stable at a decent number.<br /><br />I can also attest that my refrigerator ice maker will not function when the filter is close to end of life.

I took the filter out put it upside down and shook it really really hard getting the excess water out and when it seemed like no more water would come out of the filter I reinserted it and hooray! The water is now working. So if any of you have a problem with the water dispenser stopping just take the filter out turn it upside down shake the heck out of it and then put it back in and it should get it unclogged and your dispenser working again.

It does not remove minerals... which for those of us that have espresso machines or pour over coffee pots need to retain the flavor of the beans. Water is a great cleaner and when you remove all of the minerals, it then wants to get them from somewhere. What i suggest  for making espresso and coffee as well as iced tea and possibly even powerder drinks it use this filter to  remove all of the sludge and poison, and then the zero water to reduce the hardness. For me its a 50/50 mix. i add in my refrigerator filtered water after the fact as well as the filtered tap water from the zero water pitcher. my TDS tester shows me at 48, which is almost in the center of what is recommended by the SCA for perfect espresso coffee water.

The water would not stop so I had a mini flood growing in the kitchen. I finally thought to put the old filter in and finally stopped the flow. I have reached out to Every Drop, Whirlpool ,and Pur to see if anyone can advise as to what filter I should buy as this is junk. I don't trust buying an Every Drop again. I read in these reviews that Pur used to supply the Every Drop filter but then started using a different brand and that's why the fittings don't load properly and that the length of the filter prevents the door from closing well. I'm hoping Pur actually has the filters that used their tech even tho Every Drop name is on the filters they sell on their site. My next call is to the store where I bought the fridge. Maybe they have had to deal with the repair problems caused by this filter and can rec a different one. Will update if anyone responds to my requests.<br /><br />**Update** All 3 companies responded to my inquiry. Whirlpool is sending me a replacement filter so I will let you know if it works. I will also add pics of the first filter, current filter (w/probs), and new Whirlpool filter for folks to be able to compare. Every Drop and PUR told  me to contact Whirlpool. I asked them to tell me specifically where I could buy a quality filter (as in the past) that would fit and both again referred me to Whirlpool. I am hopeful I can find a place to buy a good filter and will let you know details.<br /><br />*Update 2* received Whirpool's replacement filter and the minute i felt it I could immediately tell it was so much lighter than the one I bought here. I then noticed the one I bought here had lots of stains on it as well. After weighing it, the Whirlpool one, and the one I had previously bought from here, I am convinced that the most recent one I bought from here was used. It weighed more than the other 2, was even dirty whereas the one I replaced was still clean looking. I personally think Amazon should shut down this seller for safety reasons. They lure you in w/a good filter and when you return to buy another, God knows what is in that filter, where it was used, potential diseases, etc. The filter that started all this mess must have messed up the filter line bc now I am having issues where there is air in the line, water won't stop flowing, etc. and this is a 1 yr old fridge so I am hoping Amazon will allow the truth to stay in my review.", "images": [], "asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "parent_asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "user_id": "AFMB7SWMHABONXONVZ5MUR42IK6A", "timestamp": 1560859755499, "helpful_vote": 64, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "So far so good", "text": "Good", "images": [], "asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "parent_asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "user_id": "AEWXZY3SQJNCB4YEYSYFC7MAGM3Q", "timestamp": 1600804287898, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Must have!", "text": "I love that I can order this from Amazon and not have to go to the store!

I uploaded an image which I think shows the issue.  The filter on the right from October 2018 works fine.  The filter on the left is one of the filters which does not work.  If you look at the groves cut into the filter projections, just above the black o-rings, you will see that the groves on the filter that works (on the right) are slightly smaller than the groves on the filter on the left (which does not work).  If this is the issue, and it looks like it is, then the filter is not allowed to connect securely enough to the connections to allow water to flow through it properly.

I actually thought the refrigerator had a major malfunction--shortly after installing the filter, not only did the water stop flowing, but the refrigerator made loud banging and whirring noises.  I called an appliance repair person.  He identified that the filter had frozen, warmed it up and reinstalled it, water was flowing again.  Charged me about $100.  Within two hours, the problem was back.  At least I now knew that the water filter was the problem. Searching the internet, I found this was a known problem with some of the recently sold filters of this type--their casings are apparently the wrong size (counterfeit?). Following a \"tip,\" I folded some paper towels and taped them to the filter before reinstalling, leading to a tighter seal.  That worked, but just for a day or two.  I went though months of having this problem the water would stop/noise start, I'd remove the filter and reinstall it, it worked again for a short while.  I finally gave up, threw out the offending filter and installed another that was on my shelf from the (now cancelled) Amazon subscription.  That one worked, no problem.  But this was a big pain, I'll buy direct from the manufacturer in the future.<br /><br />Added info, 5/22:  I made the mistake of ordering another of these from Amazon.  Same problem--the fit is slightly off, so the soon the fridge starts up with a grinding/hammering noise, etc.  This time, I was able to return it and reordered direct from the manufacture.  So far no problems with the manufacturer-direct filters.

First and foremost you are not buying this filter to remove TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) you need a RO/RODI (Reverse osmosis) filter unit in order to remove TDS. At the most this filter is a sediment filter (removes undissolved solids) to a point and then uses a carbon block to remove other chemicals from the water (ex: Chlorine, smells, taste, etc.) Overall just makes the water a bit healthier and cleaner with a \u201cbetter\u201d taste apposed to tap. Also helps prevent larger particles from building up in the fridge without removing 100% of everything in the water. Again research RODI units if you want 100% \u201cclean, 0 TDS\u201d water.<br /><br />Other then that it does have a good taste to the water.<br />My biggest complaint is the cost. On average they last 6 months at $50 not on sale that\u2019s approx $8.35 a month excluding tax. For a water filter. Compared to other filter styles that don\u2019t fit this filter. I personally plan on letting the fridge bypass the filter and doing my own DIY filter in-line before it gets to the fridge. Other than the initial start up costs (less than $150) it will be approx $25 every 6 months to a year depending on use for my planned DIY filter that will accomplish the same thing as this.", "images": [], "asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "parent_asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "user_id": "AETJ3RJYNECMCSQMRODPDYRQJ7DA", "timestamp": 1549131702869, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great!", "text": "I bought a new house with a refrigerator that dispensed water that tasted the way dog breath smells.

It\u2019s quite small, and while I respect it\u2019s quality, I don\u2019t think it should cost close to $60.00 for such a small filter. Especially when they recommend changing it every 6 months!", "images": [], "asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "parent_asin": "B00UXG4WR8", "user_id": "AG4HOVAUDLOW43LUL4KDBTCBY74A", "timestamp": 1662503677125, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Better tasting water", "text": "Much better tasting water.

This indicates that the fridge doesn't have a &#34;real&#34; way to determine whether a filter is in good shape- it possibly only goes by how long it has been in the fridge or how much water it has already filtered (and I'm not even sure it would be possible for the filter or fridge to keep track of how much water it has filtered.)

I'm somewhat annoyed with Whirlpool support; I can't be the only person to have had this problem.<br /><br />I've tried four different filters with no success. With three of the filters, there was a loud hammering sound that persisted and sounded like it could damage the fridge. With this last purchase, there is a brief hammering noice then no water comes out of the dispenser, just a drop or two no matter how long I try.  When I put the old filter back in, the water flows with no problem. Unfortunately, I let the return window close so I am stuck with it.<br /><br />I should add that I chatted with Whirlpool support. Apparently they have no history of this sort of problem. Their suggestion was to try another filter --which I did-- and if that didn't work --it didn't-- place a service call. They also recommended that I check if my model fridge is still eligible for their service plan. If I place a one-time service call for this problem then I become ineligible for their service plan.

The new filter made a grinding motor sound and barely dripped water, just as others said happened to them.  I re-installed the filter several times with the same results. Then I tried the second filter I purchased, and it would not wok either.  I've had the refrigerator for 15 years and have never had any problem with factory filter replacements.  I then went to Lowe's and bought the same factory filter.  It only took a few minutes to install it, and the system worked perfectly.

To make matters even worse, because I didn't discover the problem until 6 weeks after I purchased them, I could not get a refund or replacement.  The 30-day return policy of Amazon for this class of product had expired, so I LOST OVER $90.  This company has no provision for fairly selling this type of product, where they can routinely fail or be defective.  Don't buy factory filters from Amazon.

I read several reviews on the previous generation filter (same as my new fridge) with the same complaint.  I was ready to send the fridge back.  I did a little information gathering on appliance repair sites and discovered source of the problem and occam's razor came to mind.  It was the new steel braided ice maker supply line (mine was a Watts brand made in China) I bought it new for the fridge.  Read reviews of various ice maker supply lines and you will see there is a serious problem with many manufacturers.<br /><br />Anyway I ordered a Whirlpool 8212547RP 5-Feet Pex Ice Maker Hook-up Kit from Amazon for about 8 bucks with tax (same material as the rest of the fridge's plumbing) and the water tastes fine now.  I replaced my original filter just because I considered the original to be contaminated.  The new filter tastes fine, although I am docking stars for the high price, although I imagine that it will come down in price as its a new product with limited supply at the moment.<br /><br />If you are suffering from that chemical taste: unless you have a copper, pex or a quality confirmed ice make supply line then you owe it to yourself to at least test it.  Pull your fridge out, turn the supply valve off, disconnect the supply line from the fridge.  Fill a glass with water directly from the supply line and taste it.

Not only are they quite expensive compared to other brands, but we bought a pack of 2 of this same model (from the Whirlpool website) and we had to replace the first one after ~4 weeks because the water started coming out so incredibly slowly. The 2nd filter in the pack dispensed water at a usable rate at first, and then it reduced to a trickle after 3-4 weeks as well. It's so slow now, it takes ~7-8 minutes to fill 1 liter (e.g. a SodaStream 1L bottle).<br /><br />In the video -- I'm not sure why it comes out at a weird angle, but as far as we can tell there is no blockage --- in fact when we replaced the filter with a new one, it stopped coming out at a weird angle for ~3 weeks until the problem started up again.

I installed the new filter and ran a few gallons of water as directed with no issues.  The next day the fridge started making a loud noise when dispensing water.  I had to eject the filter and push it back in to get it to work.  Not a viable solution.  It was like the O-Rings were not sealing and sucking air into the line.  I had already thrown the old one away, so I couldn't put that one back in or use the O-Rings from the old one.  My work-around was to use plumbers (Teflon) tape around the two O-Rings.  3 or 4 layers.  My advice.  Keep your old one for a few day in case you have issues.  Like I said before, I've never had and issue with these before and in my experience is uncommon.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It seems the O-Rings were NOT the problem.  It worked for a day or so but the issue (jack hammer sound) came back.  However, I did find this solution by searching on the internet:  Whirlpool switched from the purple PUR filters to the new Everydrop filters which have a slight difference in the length of the filters. These are about 1/16 \" shorter. (I couldn't verify this claim though as I do not have an old PUR filter to compare with).  The filter door is causing the filter to not seat all the way into the filter housing for a tight seal. I folded a paper towel up into a square and put it between the back of the filter and the door and that seated it securely.
