5,Buy it!! First time my granddaughter wasn't screaming.,My granddaughter has long hair with just enough curl to develop tangles and knots. This lil brush is the first time she wasn't screaming and actually could brush her hair thoroughly on her own instead of giving up. Her mom even liked it eno to use it instead of her normal Brush. She thinks it may be because the bristles are shorter. But we're very happy with this purchase.,[],B00JJ7T2V8,B01EY96W72,AEUB5D7J3DHZLJG464FXDDVMMUGA,2021-12-18 23:05:28.660,0,True

4,"Gets the job done, works well, great for keeping in a purse or backpack.","I love this brush.  I love that it has a cap for the bristles that helps keep hair from getting into my bag, protects the bristles, and keeps stuff from getting stuck in the bristles.  It brushes well.

The only thing I don't LOVE this brush for is heat styling.  I can't hold hair in the brush and blowdry like I can with my other brushes.  That being said, I don't usually heat style.

5,True Holy Grail product,"4C hair chick here. Anyone struggling with knots and tangles and kinks, this is the brush to have.<br /><br /> I have hair that tangles whether it is wet or dry. I have used a vent brush, a Denman, and a bunch of other random detangling tools. I liked the vented brush and that's what I have been using because I thought it was decent. You can see by the photos why the Teezer blows that out of the water.<br /><br />Not only does this glide through my hair but it also is great for applying product. Sometimes, I like to use a brush to smooth product into my hair because it will have a ""waving"" effect. It's hard to do with other brushes because of the tangling.<br /><br />Make sure that you get the correct version of this brush for your hair. I got this Thick and Curly version for my very coarse, 4C afro-natural hair. I have read some reviews online where users complained that the brush didn't work for them. I don't think the other versions can handle 4C hair for long. This one though...

2,Hair Loss and Extended Brushing Time...but Very Cute,"This was recommended by a medical professional to reduce damage and help detangle. It's adorable, and I LOVE the design. However, since I started using this, I've had massive hair loss (I'm not at that stage of life yet). I'm talking a large handful a day, and shedding excessively everywhere I go. I'm freaking out. On top of that, it takes me at least three times as long to brush and detangle my wet hair than the comb I was using before. I don't understand, but this is doing just about the opposite of what it was designed to do. I've had better luck using it dry. It does still pull hair out, but it gets my hair soft and smooth. I usually don't brush my hair after the initial wet combing, because trying to detangle it and then dealing with frizz just isn't worth it. This brush gives a better result, so I might use it for dry hair now and then, if I feel I can afford the hair loss. I'm moving back to my old comb to see if I stop losing so much hair. If I do, I'll reduce this rating to one star. If I keep losing hair, I'll have to look into health issues and might raise the rating. Either way, the brush certainly doesn't HELP with hair loss/breakage, and it takes a ridiculously long time to use (long enough that it's not realistic for getting ready quickly in the mornings). I can't really see a reason to buy this above flat, wide-toothed combs/brushes like what I was using before.",[],B008HJRLXK,B01EY96W72,AFRUUVENUE6GZ3KN5YHMWSR4P7MQ,2018-07-09 03:36:06.063,1,True

5,Love these!!!!,"I absolutely LOVE these brushes!<br /><br />Two of my three daughters and I have fine, thin, and easily tangled hair. Brushing hair is always a painful ordeal. So, I got three of these.<br /><br />My other daughter has slightly thicker, wavier, hair strands, but brushing takes forever because her hair is super long (about butt length). That’s a lot of hair for a seven year old to deal with. (I got her the Tangle Teezer for thick, curly hair because I wasn’t sure the fine bristles on these ones would get through her hair, and it works perfectly for her as well. Note that she tried ours and I think this one would work too, but the thick/curly brush works a little better and faster).<br /><br />My ten year old (who winces and complains even while brushing her own hair) said, “These will change our lives!”<br /><br />I was worried they would be difficult for the kids to hold, but even my tiny six year old had no issue.<br /><br />We all loved how smooth these made our hair and how quickly we could get it brushed with virtually no pain.<br /><br />These are amazing.

Doesn’t hurt! Fast!<br /><br />I love how it doesn’t have a handle so I can be even more careful with my mane. Control.<br /><br />This mini size is better for me because it fits in my hands better.

5,"Wonderful product, however, will NOT make your child magically responsible about hair brushing 😉","I bought this for my 10 year old daughter to use on the dreadlock that forms under her very thick, long, and unruly hair. It becomes so bad that she will stop brushing all of her hair and then I have to force her to let me help which ends in tears for everyone! This brush was a welcome addition to that process! It works quickly on the tangles and is not as painful for her which makes it less painful for me as well. Because her hair is not damaged, we use this after showers when her hair is wet and well conditioned (if your hair is damaged you should not brush it while wet as this is when it is most vulnerable to breakage).<br /><br />This product will not, however, inspire my child to be consistent with her hair brushing. Because her hair is so unruly and thick, these dreadlocks form easily if she doesn’t brush her hair morning and night (if she shaved her head it would stick straight up in a baseball sized circle right on the crown of her hear because that area has around 55 cowlicks, no joke! Even putting her hair into a neat pony tale is difficult because the cowlicks cause it to point in 7 different directions at once). Of course, being 10, she could care less about being consistent as other things are more important to her right now!

5,Really Does Work!,"Ok, I'm impressed!  Even using conditioner, my hair still ends up in tangles at the end of a shower and I've always had to coax out the tangles by starting brushing at the ends and working up.  I haven't had to do that with this brush.  The bristles are designed to &#34;give&#34; so if it runs into a tangle, it's not going to yank until the hair falls out.  You can gently go over the tangle several times until it eventually straightens, maybe 8 to 10 times depending on how matted your hair is.  I especially like that it has a cover over the bristles to keep them from getting crushed.  The only thing I can see that is a downfall is in the design.  While it fits nicely into the curve of my hand, it is a bit bulky at 2&#34; thick and takes up a decent amount of space in a smaller sized purse.  If you're not using it on the go or don't have the small purse size problem, it's the perfect brush to have around that will not leave you terribly frustrated with your tangled hair.",[],B0045U707M,B01EY96W72,AGOA7BWDPVRUG5K4HHKQFHALDRHA,2013-01-30 06:06:57.000,1,True

1,HAIR HELL!!! Nearly destroyed my hair.,"Save yourself the anxiety, stress, and panic. Do NOT buy this brush. In two days this brush very nearly ruined my hair. It appeared dry and frizzy. The outside layer was fine, but it was nothing but matts underneath. My go to hair oil did nothing. Wash day was terrible - hair everywhere, mats and knots throughout. I was terrified I was going to have to cut it all off and start over again. I was not looking forward to it. No part of my regular hair care routine (something I have perfected over the course of about 5 years now) did anything to make it better. Finally I broke down and used my old Goody brush. I had brushed through my hair with the tangle teezer dozens of times at this point and it seemed detangled, but it took several minutes to detangle my hair with the old brush, then my hair was just fine. I added in my trusty hair oil. After two days of pure hair hell, my hair is shiny, silky, and beautiful again. I will be throwing this brush away. It was less than useless. It left me with a tangled mess of knots that, left with just this brush, would have all had to be cut out.",[],B08J1MP6DB,B01EY96W72,AFP2XHBRF4A47JAWKI6434QOQ5LA,2021-07-03 22:24:47.670,2,True

1,Stick to Felicia Leatherwood,"I attempted to use this gadget to detangle my curly, 3c/4a, low porosity, past shoulder length hair.  My standard is to be able to start detangling from the ends and work your way up to the scalp without having to do too much (I don't section at all) sectioning.  I flip my hair upside-down and start brushing starting from my left side, ends to scalp and work my way to the right side.  From here I am able to brush (using my Felicia Leatherwood) starting from the back of my head to the front and I am tangle free with ease.

5,Like magic!,"I saw a few reviews of this brush on youtube. I have two young girls with curly (and subsequently very prone to tangles) hair. Prior to this, combing through my girls hair was a screaming, crying nightmare- for both of us. And yes, I did use tons of conditioner and start at the ends first. This thing is weird looking, but it works through tangles and mats like magic! I can go through three- day matted hair in about 5 minutes, it barely tugs or pulls. It's really lightweight and I like the shape of the brush. Some people prefer the handle, but this is just fine for me- even with conditioner sopped hands. It seems a little flimsy at first, but it will get through the hair no problem. The tons of little bristles work well and feel really nice on the scalp. I exercise a lot and my hair gets matted, sweaty and tangled. I'm used to having hair ripped out when I use a paddle brush or a comb, but now this brush is my go to. I almost had a panic attack when it was time for wash day and I couldn't find it.  If you have thicker hair, go for the thick and curly version of it.

5,No more bent bristles! But lefties beware...,"I have Tangle Teezers already (full sized) but you can't pack in your everyday bag without bending the bristles. Once the bristles are bent they don't perform quite as well and can start pulling hair out. They are also on the large side. So I'm so glad they finally made a pocket sized one with a snap on bristle protector. It is much more pocket sized, works just as well as the large one, and the design/color scheme is very nice.

5,Does not break my hair! I love it!,"This brush was recommended to me by several people with varying thickness of hair. Mine is normal but corkicelli curls. It tends to tangle in the back, underneath at the nape... which can be painful to derange and usually breaks at least some of my hair, even if I detangle while wet with conditioner. (You can tell if it's breaking your hair if there is no little bulb on one end of the hair in your brush.) I have been using this brush since I received it - no pain! It's very gentle. I only ever see a few hairs in the brush and they all have little growth bulbs on them... Meaning it's just normal hair falling out. This brush doe not break my hair off and it doesn't pull my hair out. I LOVE IT! I would think if you have little ones it would be great for them too. Tear-free detangling is awesome. I'm trying to grow my hair out not yank it out or break it off! This brush has flexible bristles to ease out tangles without harming the hair or scalp and no seams on the bristles to catch hair in... so I'll be sticking with Tangle Teaser Detangling brushes from now on!

1,This is a Dog Grooming Brush,"I have used products just like this years ago to groom my dogs fur. Considering that I wasn't exactly happy to be using something like this on my hair once I saw what it was when I got it.<br /><br /> First of all this thing is cheap. It seriously can cost more than a few cents to make. It's like dollar store quality. It has no weight to it at all and it's hallow inside. It doesn't even feel like a quality brush even ones for the comparable price.<br /><br />"" It's like trying to brush your hair with a bar of soap.""<br /><br />Holding it in your hand it feels like a computer mouse and designed to look like one it's also comparably the same size. I can't imagine how much fun this is when your hand are covered in greasy/slippery moisturizing hair care products when these has no sort of grip to hold it at all. Even brushes with handles slip out our hands now imagine using something that doesn't even have a handle on it and is smooth and light. It's like trying to brush your hair with a bar of soap.<br /><br />The detangling aspect of this brush which is why people buy it is going to vary of course depending on your hair texture and style. I however purchased the ""Thick & Curly"" version and I also have ""Thick & Curly"" hair so this is the brush they made for me or so it advertises.<br /><br />This brush is again like a dog grooming brush and works the same way. It captures loose hair in its bristles while allowing itself to ""straighten out"" hair.  This doesn't work so well when applied to people because these bristles are not designed for thicker portions of hair. Instead of picking up lose hair it rips out good hair as it picks it up like velcro.<br /><br />The bristles are also very uncomfortable as they are just cheap HARD plastic that stab into your scalp and scrap it. I mean this brush actually scares me because of that. They could have used the same design with more comfortable material for the bristles.<br /><br />The long story short of course this is going back! Get something else that's better quality and more comfortable on your hair and scalp. Don't bother ripping your hair out with this cheap product.",[],B084D6T768,B01EY96W72,AFRHPC7CFZICVH4IROAQCO7RL2GQ,2020-10-30 03:21:53.195,0,True

The Denman Brush is great, but unfortunately after a year of use, the Denman ended up being too rough for my hair due to the rubber cushion. Since the tangle teezer basically has the same seamless bristles WITHOUT the rubber, this was able to detangle just as fast as the Denman, without all the friction. If you have fragile hair, you'll definitly enjoy this.<br /><br />There's definitly a period of adjustment for this brush though. It's weird for me to use a brush with no handle, and it's weird how flat the bristle board is too. Also, I wouldn't recommend this brush for any kind of styling. Being so gentle, this is definitly only good for brushing and detangling.<br /><br />I'm positive my product is new too. It had some minor scuffs where the brush rubs against the box it comes in.

5,It's Amazing!,"I don't normally write reviews but.. this detangling brush is AH-mazing!! I have beautiful fine strand, high density, long 4c hair and I used to hate wash days because of the trouble detangling would give me. I would be in the bathroom for over an hour or two just detangling my hair. It didn't help that I'm tender-headed! I'd get so frustrated that I'd just start ripping through my hair. And then I discovered this brush by watching YouTube videos. I was worried that this brush would cause breakage and damage to my hair but after watching TONS of videos and obsessing over the brush for forever I have finally decided to take the plunge. I am so happy and relieved I have purchased this brush. It does wonders for my hair and it makes my detangling process super relaxing instead of ridiculously stressful. It takes me no more than forty-five minutes, if I'm not mindlessly brushing for relaxing purposes, to detangle my previously ""unmanageable"" hair. I now look forward to wash days instead of dreading them and it's all thanks to this brush!

I often have to take breaks brushing my hair (wet or dry) because it takes so much out of me. So much so my fiance has to end up brushing it for me. It’s humiliating. My hair is thick and waist length and gets SO horribly knotted and matted (I dont cut it because it’s the one thing that gives me dignity in this debilitating illness.)  I got this device because it had so many good reviews and I really wanted to find SOMETHING that would lessen the dread, the pain, the strength, and time required to brush my hair after it’s been untouched for a week or more.  I tried this right away and it effortlessly and painlessly brushed through my 4 -day unbrushed hair. It literally took 30 seconds to do my entire head (with a normal brush it was taking me about 30 minutes with many breaks just to get the knots out. This felt amazing on my scalp and gave my hair a softness I have not experienced before. This is literally a game changer for me. I am so happy that I got this and am going to buy more. If you are on the fence like I was and debating getting it, TRUST ME GET IT. It will change your life especially if you have a condition like mine. Thank you.

5,Wonderful Brush. Best purchase I have made in months.,"Wow this brush is amazing. I don't have hair that is exactly hard to take care of (straight hair) but combing my bed head every morning with the wide tooth comb I was using before *hurt*. Even though I have pin-straight hair, my little sister has very curly hair that was hard to brush or comb through. She would start crying and throwing a fit whenever my mom or me would try to brush her hair for school. But now her and I love to brush our hair, and we do it very often. The feel of the brush on the scalp is wonderful, and its not hard to hold either when my hands are dry. This brush isn't just amazing on people, its great on pets too. I started brushing one of my cats a day ago just to see how he would react to the brush, and he almost immediately started to purr loudly and rub his face against the bristles. He wouldn't leave me alone for about a whole 15 minutes begging for more brushings. Another one of my cats has long hair and struggles to groom himself, but ever simce I started using this brush on him, he has been looking the most beautiful I have ever seen him (and he seems to be happier too). My dog also has long hair and it works great on him too.<br /><br />TLDR: Brush is great. Works wonderfully on human and animal hair.

2,"Great as a vegan boar brush alternative, but terrible for tangles","I have very fine and extremely little hair (hairloss kind of thin). I didn't really need a brush for tangles, I have very little knots as long as I use conditioner and a comb works just fine getting them untangled.<br /><br />I was really surprised that this brush couldn't get trough tangles when wet. The pins are just too flexible and scrape over the top of the hair, not going through. Using more pressure just bend the pins (see picture). On dry hair it's more effective, but I still felt like it could barely handle my hair, let alone if someone had thick dense hair.<br /><br />Is this brush of no use then? No, it is. I actually like it on dry hair to distribute oils from the scalp through the hair, making it shiny. It also breaks up flakes (great when you have dandruff) and stimulates blood flow if you brush a lot which is good for hair growth. It's a great alternative to a boar brush in this way and it's vegan friendly!<br /><br />But it being a 'tangle teezer' I have to give it 2 stars.

5,AMAZING! But wait there's more!,"So I have very long fine hair, probably around (3 feet in length) and a rather sensitive scalp. I always have and as such I have gotten used to dealing with it certain ways.<br /><br />For example, I was used to waiting for a few hours for it to dry naturally before even attempting to put it in order. This usually takes around two hours.<br /><br />I also have tried just about every sort of brush at one time or another. Natural bristles, Plastic that imitates natural bristles, Normal (Nowadays) what we called paddle brushes in my house, wide ones skinny ones, Combs of every shape and size, Brushing it dry, wet, blowdrying (omg that was a terrible idea with my hair, what a rat's nest that became! Yes even when doing it ""properly"" I tried on multiple occasions.)<br /><br />But the point is that when my sister came up to me just after a shower and told me that I HAD to try this brush I was not expecting much. I told her I would after my hair dried and she insisted that I try it right away. I did expecting a fight to get the funny looking thing back out of my hair but even just two strokes was enough to convince me that I had found my forever brush.<br /><br />Never had anything been able to untangle my hair so easily. It was so painless! Even without leave-in conditioners! Now I can brush my hair dripping wet out of the shower in less than three minutes.<br /><br />It also feels great on my scalp. Not too sharp or aggressive but gently scratches. (Stimulation also helps hair growth!)<br /><br />I won't say that I don't lose any hair while using it, but I lose much less than I did with normal brushes. By a LOT.<br /><br />It's not totally comfortable at all angles and I do drop it on occasion but I think that mostly due to how long my hair is. I've considered getting the one with the handle but I don't really need two of these things for myself and it's only a minor inconvenience anyway.<br /><br />I haven't had any bristles break on me yet and I'm coming up on a year of ownership, I will say that I have been careful not to shove it in a purse or drawer since I think it might damage the bristles. It lives on the dresser top bristles side up to keep them safe. If you are going to take in on the go you should get the one with the bottom attachment.<br /><br />Speaking of the bottom attachment, I did buy another one with the bottom attachment for my cats. (Yeah you read that right.) And there are some important differences. First the bottom attachment stays on fairly easily and well. As I mentioned if you travel a lot you should pick it instead. But it is also smaller. The bristle surface goes from 4 inches on the big one to 3 inches on the one with the bottom. (I just used a ruler to measure.) The width is about the same on both. And the one with the bottom also is more uniform all the way around, vs the big one which is supposed to fit into the shape of your hand.<br /><br />I have tested this brush on both cats and dogs and found out that it works quite well, and at least the pets I tried it out on really enjoy it.<br /><br />One is a 20 year old cat that has more trouble grooming than she used to and I think she really likes a thorough scratching every few days. I have a 12 year old cat that cannot get enough of it and runs over while I'm brushing my own hair to demand some time with the brush.<br /><br />Also on a 6 year old short hair German Shepard. It took out a lot more loose dog fur than I was expecting. And a 5 year old Great Pyrenees that had such a massive amount of fur that I thought the brush might have met its match. But it surprised me once more by not only taking out as much fur as a FURminator, but even unmatting the elbow fur (Constantly mats, anyone with a long haired dog know exactly what I'm talking about) in minutes! And he loved the whole 45 minute treatment!<br /><br />I'd recommend this brush to anyone and everyone with hair! Or pets! And I have to practically everyone I know lol.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is that you really shouldn't use it under water, not while in the shower not submerging it, DON'T drop it in a tub. I wouldn't even keep it in the bathroom since water can get inside it. For that reason I also tend not to use it with other products (Or just beforehand) because I don't want to get a mildew situation from having to clean it and getting water stuck inside it.<br /><br />Overall I have been really amazed at what this brush can do. It is a most excellent product. 10/10",[],B01NA7KNTS,B01EY96W72,AFQXX6K2MIF4AP665GEKL3F2FWMQ,2022-03-31 04:34:44.154,36,True

This brush works OK on my hair when it's dry but it has a tendency to snag and yank the brush out of my hands. So when I wet my hair and brush I hear angels sing! Literally! This is the only hair apparatus that can go from my roots to the end  w/o pulling out my hair or snagging it. When I put conditioner in it it works even better.<br />With my new found discovery I learned-six years later-that I CAN NOT comb or brush my hair when it's dry. I just can't.<br />Even though this brush can be used on dry hair, I can't do so with mine.<br />Another hard lesson I learned is that the original TT brush comes in two different sizes: The compact which is 3x2.5"" which is too small for me and the original size which is roughly 5x3.5"". I can't find that size that's in the glittery purple anywhere!!<br />My poor brush is a bit damaged from dropping it so much because I didn't know at the time combing my hair while it was dry is a definite no-no so until I can find one that's the exact size and color I will stick to my stripped brush.

I bought this brush and starting intentionally brushing it daily my hair seems to have thickened up a little and started growing a little faster again, it's also a nice relaxing feeling for long hair, like brushing horse or doll hair and so much easier to clean out than wet brushes, no lint!<br />Update 5 months later: still was working well, my hair looks healthier when I use it, but I noticed even with my baby fine hair, bristles were a bit  bent and the seam of the brush was coming apart quite a bit and I couldn't push it back together...afraid it would tangle my in my long hair and pull it out but not ready to give up my favorite brush I reordered... new brush feels amazing so it was definitely time for a replacement...still my favorite brush but I wouldn't recommend for use in the hand of anyone but a very gentle adult on the head of baby fine hair (whether that be that adult's or actually a child's head)...just remember both  ""fine and fragile"" if that describes your hair-type perfectly and this is the brush for you",[],B07L5QFNKM,B01EY96W72,AG2AR6XGWZ7HN6XM2USE7JUTEXDQ,2021-08-18 01:36:53.003,8,True

5,Best brush I've ever owned. A must for synthetic hair. Get one with a handle.,I've had two of these brushes. First one I had I lost- it was a black one that didn't have a handle. Got a pink replacement one with a handle. Might be a personal preference as they both work great- but I prefer the one with the handle. These work great for both human and synthetic hair. Gets the tangles out of synthetic hair without the need to add product- I just use some water out of a spray bottle. I've needed synthetic pieces for about 35 years due to a medical condition so I've had hundreds of them. I can tell you that not using product cuts down on how often a synthetic piece has to be washed- and pieces last much longer the less they are washed and manipulated.

The teeth on this brush are soft on my skin, and soft on my cats, too, and works amazingly well at going through their mats without yanking out fur. It’s also the easiest brush I’ve ever had to clean, for me or pets. Hair lifts right out. No more scratchy pet brushes. It even works on my daughter’s black mouth cur, who has short, wiry fur. The dog is a shedding machine, but her fur never came out in a dog brush, no matter how much she was brushed. It does in this brush, and cleanup is easy.

5,Great for young girls who hate brushing their own hair.,"This tangle teezer is great! It easily glides through my hair and cleaning it is a breeze. I had bought this boar-bristle brush and because I had waist-length hair, it picked up a lot of dust and stuff, which that brush picked up and there was no way to clean it out, so I had to find a new brush. I saw that a couple Youtubers use this brush so I decided to check it out for myself. I'm glad I did, because it is the best brush I have ever used. It's gentle on your hair yet gets all those tangles out. I have a younger sister who absolutely hates brushing her hair, so she always has these nests of tangles behind her head. It was terrible trying to get her to brush her own hair (it hurt to brush those tangles out), so I often had to do it myself.

3,I Don’t Like It,"I got the “pink” fine hair detangler brush after reading so many rave reviews, and regret it.<br /><br />Color wise, it’s not pink at all, it’s orchid.<br /><br />The brush feels and looks cheap, is hollow, and is hard to handle. It regularly goes flying to the floor, and splits open into pieces at the seam, needing to be reassembled. The separate piece construction is a mold hazard if you use it on damp hair. I now split it open to let it dry out after each use.<br /><br />The detangling is not impressive, and it takes quite a bit of effort to get untangled. I noticed no difference in breakage from any other brush, and less detangling performance than the type of brush with ball ended plastic bristles. If you use it on dry hair, it deflates it, knocking out the body and fullness irreparably, and it’s impossible to even use it to make a basic ponytail- handleless and the teeth are not conducive for it at all.<br /><br />Buy yourself a tried and true brush and skip this thing- it’s not worth it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610+uqJIjhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610+uqJIjhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610+uqJIjhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07L5QFNKM,B01EY96W72,AEUP4SH2OLH3QGF3JTKUDC7WS4BA,2020-10-25 19:29:28.029,37,True

I was tired of the tears every morning and night when I would try to detangle and brush her hair. LET ME TELL YOU. when this brush came in, she said it didn't even hurt her head/hair & felt nice when I brushed her hair. I started detangling her hair from the bottom up, and it only took two minutes, which is a record for how long it takes to detangle her fine wispy long hair. I have never hopped back on amazon so fast to buy one for me. I have thick hair, and the teeth on this brush are a little bit longer than the original tangle teezer-- it feels nice when I brush my hair and scalp, and I might order a couple more to keep in the car and my bag. Highly HIGHLY recommend. This brush trumps all the WET brand brushes I have tried in the past, that are now in the trash.<br /><br />I don't know what the feature ""Stretch"" means - but the teeth on the brush have some give.

Outside of shower use I would have the same problem with my leave in conditioner. It made it hard to grip and it would go flying once I got through with a tangle.

5,Naptural Hair Life Saver,I purchased this item after seeing a hair influencer's You tube video on how she detangles her hair (which was very similar to my curl pattern). At that point I was considering cutting off all my hair or using relaxer because it was too much work to maintain. I've been using the Tangle Teezer for months now and I couldn't be happier. This product is easy to hold even though I'm a bit clumpsy lol. It gently glides through my incredibly thick curly coily hair without any painful pulling and detangles it with just one to two comb throughs. I can actually run my fingers through my hair when I'm done which I never thought would be possible. It's perfect for a wash and go or simply to get my hair ready to put in a protective style. It has help to keep my hair from breaking/ shedding which is very important to me as I love my hair's full body and thickness. Had I not found that video and the Tangle Teezer I would've done another big chop or just given up entirely. I love how much this has helped me to maintain my hair's Naptural beauty.,[],B0086QEO7K,B01EY96W72,AFXDYNENGE23MXYGFXT6Z4YGNMNA,2020-06-01 14:59:55.035,0,True
5,Love it so much I started giving them out as gifts,"I've been a long-term user of tangle teezers for my thick, straight head of fine hair. It's great for detangling with minimal breakage, and cuts down my time brushing my hair from 10 minutes to less than 5. I already knew I loved this product, but I wasn't sure if my mom would, as she has a much thinner head of hair, and her hair is brittle from years of dyeing it.<br /><br />I got the fine and fragile version of the tangle teezer for her. She has limited mobility of her dominant arm, so hair styling and brushing has always been a struggle for her. She instantly fell in love with it! She said it's very easy for her to use and is gentle on her hair. She's able to do all of her hair brushing one-handed now without issue. You know when you get a knot so rough you have to use both hands to get it out without some insane pain? She doesn't have to do that at all anymore, which is great both for her hair and her arm.<br /><br />Tangle Teezers are great for any girl who has to regularly detangle their hair. Once you start using these, you never go back to brushes again!

The thinner side up was for smaller sections. However, it will slip and fly out of your wet hands.<br /><br /> I tried it on dry hair. I stopped because I felt like I was pulling out my hair strands. I sectioned my hair into 4 parts. I wet my hair with a spray bottle.  I started to detangle and was amazed with results. With about 3 to 4 passes my hair was tangle free and defined with tighter coils & curls. I loved my results. However, there were a lot of hair shedding in the teezer.<br /><br />I noticed this defines my hair tighter than my denman brush. I have mixed hair. My crown is 3c. My sides are 4a. My back is all 4 (a,b,c).<br /><br />This detangler left my hair tangle free with no frizz<br /><br />Now came wash day. I had a different experience.<br /><br /> It was hard to hold the teezer with wet hands. It kept on falling out. Instead of my hair being elongated from the water, it was poufy. My coils & curls were tight & clumped together.  I had less hair shedding than my regular wash day and when I first used this product.<br /><br />I usually used a detangling wide tooth comb & den man brush to detangle. With this method my crown would be straight, my sides would be loose coils with frizz and my back would be coils & frizz. My hair would be soaking wet. I usually have to change my hair towel before styling. Not with this product.<br /><br />I feel like I am  styling someone else’s hair.

My oldest still claims it is a great brush but all I'm really seeing is a lot of long hair breakage. My girls have long, thin hair, but a lot of it. They play and run a lot- so it does get really tangled. I typically use a brush with space between the bristles and plastic bits on the ends. I brush carefully and work the top, then the ends- its slow, but it works. This brush is literally no different- only it seems to take longer- and it breaks the hair.

I was extremely impressed the first time I used it and every time I've used it since.  It gets out all of my knots extremely fast and also very gently.  I don't regret the purchase.

The kids were even WORSE!  :D<br /><br />Enter the tangle teezer.  I bought one on a whim at a local drugstore.  Oh. My.  We all stood in awestruck silence.  Peace reigned morning after morning.  This brush has soft, flexible 'bristles' of different heights that gently push through each layer of tangle, going deeper each time as the tangles are smoothed into submission.  The bristles flex, so they don't get caught in snarls and pull the hair - they just glide over them, gently un-snarling them one brushstroke at a time.

My entire haircare routine has changed, my hair looks and feels better than it ever has, and it started with this comb.<br /><br />I have fine, wavy hair, but I have a LOT of it. It knots easily and combing it out after a wash has always been a nightmare, and sometimes involved scissors. Not anymore! I run the Tangle Teezer through my hair a few times while it's wet and the knots just disappear--it's like magic. It does a good job distributing leave-in conditioner or detangler, too. I also use it dry on occasion, as it's excellent for smoothing flyaways, but I prefer a vented brush for styling because the way you have to hold the Tangle Teezer really only leaves you one hand to work with. I knocked a star off for ergonomics because if you have small hands (as I do), it's really not intuitive to figure out the best way to use this brush, and you may end up with some carpal discomfort until you get the hang of it.

5,Thick hair? Tangles everywhere? Try this!,"I bought this because I heard really good reviews about it. It's supposed to make detangling your hair easier, which is very important to me since I have very long and thick hair that is pretty much always tangled at some point.<br /><br />I love almost everything about this brush. The plastic bristles and hair and well spaced out, so brushing this over your scalp literally feels like a head massage. Super nice. I think the lack of little bulbs at the end of the bristles also help getting them inside the hair knots and smoothing them out. There is quite some breakage, but I'm pretty much used to that and no brush has ever eliminated breakage for me. I like how this doesn't get gross when it's wet because it's just plastic, and cleaning out the hair from this is very very easy. The one thing I don't really like about it is the fact that there is no handle and you have to wrap your hand around it to brush out your hair. I understand that the grip is probably part of why it's an effective way to detangle, but still, holding a thinner handle is more comfortable than a large brush.<br />I've had this and a Wet brush, and I have to say that I prefer this by far because of how it feels and how quickly it does the job. I was recently at a hair stylist and he used this on me, so I can also safely say that this is also liked by professionals!

3,Be Wary Of The Seam Between The Bristles And The Palm Grip,"May 10, 2016<br /><br />Why I Purchased This Product: I am a Black/Filipina with medium-length (used to be waist-length, but being unable to find proper hair care tools has really done a number on my hair) fine, dense, wavy, unruly, kinky type hair. And my hair likes to eat hair brushes. When I purchased this brush a couple of years ago at Sally's Beauty Supply, I thought, &#34;This is it! This is the one that my hair can't defeat!&#34; And I really believed that.<br /><br />-----<br />What I'm Looking For In Products, Like This: I wanted a brush that could do the following things: detangle my hair without damaging it, help my hair become healthy and lovely, give me an incredible scalp massage and relieve my itchy, dandruff-ridden scalp, and not get broken, worn out, or otherwise damaged by my hair, because my hair does that. Seriously. I now regret throwing away all of the hair brushes that have snapped, lost bristles, and just got plain worn out, as it would have made for a truly impressive looking hair brush graveyard to put on display. That being said, we wouldn't have room for much else in our home. So maybe the better compromise would be to take a death picture of them. Sigh. Live and learn.<br /><br />-----<br />How This Product Measured Up To Expectations: Please understand that I really, truly believed that this brush was going to be it. It was going to be the brush of my dreams. I wanted to like this brush, so badly, that, for a while, I ignored the fact that it actually did break my hair, every now and then, when it got caught in the seam between the actual bristles and the rest of the brush. But because it did seem to be going through my hair rather well, I simply detached the bristles of the brush from the dark purple part and kept using it, that way. That seemed to work, fine, until I realized, by the time February rolled around (I purchased it either at the end of December or the beginning of January of a couple of years ago, can't recall which), which was about a month after I began using the brush, that the bristle ends looked worn out. I thought, maybe, it was just my imagination, until I realized that continued use of the brush, because of the worn bristles, was actually beginning to damage my hair, rather than keep it safe. So I ended up having to discontinue using the brush. I was... disappointed, to say the least.<br /><br />-----<br />Final Rating: I decided to give the brush a rating of three stars out of five, because it may likely work, just fine, for hair that isn't as unruly and kinky as my own. And, hey, it lasted at least a month, which is more than what I can say for a few other brushes that died a sad and sorry death after the first or second use. So I think that's at least earned it an &#34;It's Okay&#34; rating. It was after this that I finally gave up on the use of brushed and went to combs, which haven't made me happy, but they at least don't get eaten by my hair. But I'm thinking about starting another round of brush searching, just in case 2016 might be the year I find that perfect brush I've been seeking. Maybe, somewhere, there's a brush that my hair won't overwhelm or otherwise break. Maybe, someday, I'll also get that pony! Who knows?<br /><br />-----<br />Summary (Pros):<br /><br />1) As long as I was careful to avoid the seam in the brush, it didn't break and snap my hair, like others have done, in the past.<br /><br />Summary (Cons):<br /><br />1) I had to remove the bristles from the main part of the brush in order to prevent breakage from my hair getting caught in the seam.<br /><br />2) While it put up a valiant effort, it just wasn't up to a war of attrition: it wore out after about a month's worth of use.<br /><br />Rest well, Tangle Teezer.

5,It works! Best hairbrush ever!!,"Wow! Where has this hairbrush been all my life?! It is amazing! My hair is straight and on the thinner side due to losing so much hair from having my babies, which is why I needed a brush that won’t cause additional hair loss by pulling it out when brushing. Although I have thin hair, my hair has gotten so long (quarantine hair) so it tangles easily. I already bought another brush from a different brand but it was so bad. It pulled so much of my hair out that I dreaded combing my hair. My mom finally suggest I googled for the best hairbrush and tada! This came up first in my search. Bought it based off of the strong and great reviews and wow! I’m in love. Sure the shape appears a little weird initially as some others have said but when I held it, the shape was so natural to my hand (I am right handed btw). I love the teeth. I love running it through my scalp and most importantly it detangles my hair so quickly and painlessly with no extra hair coming out. Completely worth the money! Best purchase I’ve made in awhile.

5,Holy grail everyday detangling brush!,"It's been a year since I purchased this brush and it's still my go-to everyday!

First of all I love the clor combination of purple and pink and the size is just perfect for my hands.

5,Terrific for in and out of the shower,"I let my hair grow out during covid (ordinarily have a crewcut) and realized I needed a brush (haven't owned one in decades).

I have dandruff and having longer hair makes it tougher to massage my scalp when shampooing. This brush has no problems doing so.

1,I wanted to like this so bad but I just cant. 😩,The bristles are weak AF which was the first strike.  If they were just a touch stiffer. This would probably do a great job.  I got this because I had one for 3 years that was a knock off from the dollar store that I loved to bits and needed to replace. We one strike was how awkward it feels in the hand was thinking that I should have gone for the one with the handle but this was cheaper and I'm a broke b!tch. Ended up losing so much hair because I'm lazy and I get nappy and just throw it in a pony and ignore it cause I have no hot water at home so me and my husband go to the truck stop to shower at $15 a pop and again I am a broke b!tch. I can only brush my hair if its wet which is annoying but that's just how it is so I often detangle in the shower with an excessive amount of some bomb conditioner and oil up before hand especially when my naps have mutated into dread lumps.  This brush just wasn't ready for all that I guess.  It had not been prepared. It was crying uncle🙅 by the end of my shower.

4,Works great for me!,"I have baby fine 2a hair, and a lot of it, that is very prone to ""dreading"" up when the slightest bit of wind comes along or during certain ""activities"" (keeping things PG). Detangling my hair is generally a very long (and painful) endeavor that must be done in the shower with a large amount of conditioner - this still results in a decent amount of pain in addition to a decent amount of hair being yanked out. The tangle teezer has made a much easier and gentler job out of detangling my hair day to day, but it's not perfect (though, perhaps as perfect as a detangler can get). For me, the tangle teezer is not pain-free - I still get some tugging and pulling, but this is very minimal and significantly better than anything else I've tried. I still lose a few hairs in the detangling process, but the volume is significantly reduced and it's very possible the tangle teezer is only removing shed hair tangled in with others. Even with my very, very fine hair - I find it necessary to section my hair off a bit for efficient detangling, this is only a very minor hassle but the promotional videos seem to claim this is only necessary for much thicker hair.<br /><br />If you have issues with tangling, this is definitely a worth while purchase!

5,Perfect for Thick Long 4C Hair and Glides Like Butter!,"Great for my 4C Hair! I shampooed my hair as regular with a wide tooth comb. Then I rinsed. Afterwards, I put conditioner on my 4C hair. Make sure your 4C hair is really wet with conditioner and water. Used the Tangle Teezer from the ends of my hair and worked my way up to my roots. At first it pulled and snapped a little, but when I kept going, the brush glided through smoothly like butter in my thick 4C hair! I worked in 8 to 10 sections of my thick hair. This thing saved all the pulling, snapping, crying, fussing away! I really like it!<br />Plus, when you're styling your hair after a wash, I like to do really small braids with plenty of grease to protect my hair. Using the Tangle Teezer was a breeze at detangling my thick hair! Again, it went through like butter if you work in small sections from ends to roots!

After several weeks of use, there is still screaming and crying and reluctance to brush hair. Is it the brush? Is it my child? who knows. This is much easier to use in the bathtub with my daughter's curly and tangly hair. I have noticed that it brushes out her curls and her hair has looser curls after a good brushing. With her wet brush, her curls bounce back into tight ringlets after brushing. I use this brush on myself and I like it. I have long, thick, straight hair. I have noticed that the teeth are starting to bend - after two weeks of use. I""m assuming it's because I'm using it on my long, thick hair and not just on my daughter's short, curly, thin hair.

3,"Well... Good Brush, Not Great Presentation","So I purchased this brush because I got it once before years ago and it was the best brush I’ve ever used. It gets the tangles right out and leaves my hair silky and flowing. It still does the job but my issue is how badly it looked when it arrived! As you can see in the pictures, the packing was destroyed with the bottom gaping open like it shows before I opened it. It was dirty and scuffed all over, and the packaging had rips in the plastic halfway up both sides. The brush itself was not damaged, but was dirty and scuffed up as well. After trying to clean it there is still evidence of the scuffs that won’t go away. I’ll still be using it but not really happy with how it arrived. I’m not sure if this is because of delivery or the seller but the bag was entirely clean and intact when it arrived - only the product itself was damaged. Probably wouldn’t buy from this seller again with that knowledge :/ but the brush is still good on its own.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7109uSG740L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7109uSG740L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7109uSG740L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYzNZh3NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYzNZh3NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYzNZh3NL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f1E9i4G1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f1E9i4G1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f1E9i4G1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ic6CltlKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ic6CltlKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ic6CltlKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01NA7KNTS,B01EY96W72,AEXS2C2636UXDC7KHJL5PV4ZUASA,2020-05-27 20:11:01.914,3,True

3,"Worried about water getting inside.

Made it harder to brush through knots without a handle. I miss having a handle on the brush (main reason why it will only be a travel brush and not my main brush)<br />- The base that protects the bristle connect in the middle of the brush through a hole. It made me nervous that water would get trapped in there and get moldy so I’ve made sure to shake out as much water as I can, it seems to have worked so far<br /><br />Would I recommend this product to a curly haired friend as a travel brush?

5,Where have you been all my life?,"This brush was recommended to me by a lady I follow on YouTube. Check her out at PrettyShepherd.  I have long hair that is very fine, gets tangled easily, and is color treated. One of the things I like best about this brand is that they have several different kinds of brushes for different hair types. Previously I had been using the Wet Brush which works very well, but not as good as Tangle Teezer!  It is perfectly ergonomic for holding in your hand, is gentle on my hair, but absolutely fierce on my tangles. Thus far, I’ve only used it on wet hair, but I am absolutely impressed with this brush! My only criticism is that they don’t offer very many color choices for each type of brush. I guess I’m just a little spoiled by the color and design choices by WetBrush that I had a hard time deciding on which color to get since none of them were very appealing.

5,"Thank You Shaun P, the Inventor","I have to start by saying, thank you to Shaun P.  What used to take me close to an hour now takes me 22 minutes.  Literally, I timed it.  I have long, thick hair.  Combing through my hair after a wash was always a struggle.  My arms would get tired; I would sweat like a bandit, and would have to rest after getting through each section of my hair.  I have never been one to brush my hair when it was wet; so I was skeptical about using a (detangling) hairbrush.  But I thought I would try it, even though I had never heard of it before.  What a difference!  Now I can wash, condition, detangle, comb, braid and go – all within 22 minutes.

5,This brush is magic!,"I don’t know what magical powers this thing is imbued with but it’s amazing. I’ve had it for a few months and wanted to try it several different ways before writing a review.<br /><br />I have long, wavy hair. It’s fine but dense. There’s a LOT of it. At first I tried this brush wet in the shower with conditioner. But it made my hair too heavy for the fine bristles and since the brush has no handle it made it too slippery and I kept dropping it.<br /><br />Then I tried it with just wet hair and it was still too dense/heavy and a little too slippery. There was also significant pulling and hair loss which is what I was trying to avoid by switching from a comb.<br /><br />So then I broke one of the cardinal rules of being a wavy/curly and decided to try brushing it dry. When I say it worked like a charm...it worked like a freaking CHARM. AND there was significantly less hair loss than trying to brush it wet.<br /><br />My perfect way to use this brush is to brush my hair before showering while it’s dry then finger comb or use a wide toothed comb in the shower to keep the worst of the tangles at bay while shampooing and conditioning, and then use it when my hair is damp to comb my detangling milk through. It’s dreamy. Less hair loss, shorter showers, no more avoiding washing my hair because detangling is a pain.

4,Great brush - works as promised,"I waited to try this brush until my hair was pretty bad - I have long hair that tends to get very tangled/knotty and I generally feel like I am hurting my hair when I brush it out, which is why I wanted to try this out.  My review is based on using this product WITHOUT detangling spray, but I tried again with spray, and it became even easier to brush out my tangles.<br /><br />What I like:<br />-This brush does what it claims - it is extremely effective in detangling the hair.<br />-It was surprisingly gentle - I do not feel like I was ripping my hair when I use it like I do with a normal brush<br />-The shape of the brush is very comfortable and easy to hold<br />-My hair felt amazing after I brushed it completely out.  I wanted to keep brushing my hair with this brush because I found it very relaxing, like a mini head massage<br /><br />Why it didn't get five stars:<br />-The plastic bristles on the edges are slightly bent after two uses (though I admit both times I gave the brush a tough task).  They are not terribly bent and the brush is definitely still useable.  I think the outer bristles are maybe a little more flexible than the inner ones, which is why they were more prone to bend.  It just made it slightly more difficult and I'm a little worried that over time they will bend more.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?<br />-Absolutely - I bought the two pack and plan on giving it to my sister to use on my toddler niece's wavy hair.",[],B008HJRLXK,B01EY96W72,AGLPK4B4VSX43TW574SNVU2HETRQ,2015-01-06 15:26:10.000,2,True

3,ARIVED USED WITH HAIR & A SMELL,"I was really excited about this hair brush after experiencing some recent hair loss due to a bad dying job. However, this hairbrush arrived already used but sealed back in the original packaging.<br />As soon as I opened the package, I was hit with a strange smell that was very noticeable and once I opened the package itself- it was a gross smell that smelled almost like rotten mixed with buttered popcorn.<br />I decided to look at the hairbrush and it had multiple pieces of black hair already stuck in the bristles and showed signs of use. I felt extremely disgusted, and tried to return it so they sent me a replacement.<br />Upon receiving the replacement, I was able to conclude that that one had not been used, but I did clean it thoroughly before I used it due to my suspicion that they do not check their hair brushes upon return.<br /><br />I do recommend the product- it has been very gentle on my hair.  Just check it before you use it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717z2rBUaXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717z2rBUaXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717z2rBUaXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RhF4IerfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RhF4IerfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RhF4IerfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71boL99IEZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71boL99IEZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71boL99IEZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07L5QFNKM,B01EY96W72,AHZ7SWRUQVTSXEEFQZFKJQL6YGZA,2023-01-11 14:04:51.327,1,True

5,Life-changer for me,"My hair is long and so thick that salons charge me double or even more for dyeing due to amount of work and dye expense. But the hairs themselves are thin and a bit dry, they electrify static, and tangle whenever they touch anything, like my clothes, or bedsheets - everything that isn't my own skin. For as long as I can remember, my morning routine included tons of detangling liquids, and tons of tears. I've tried everything, sometimes the situation got better, but in winters, when it's dry inside and windy outside, it all got back to this nightmare. You have no idea how much it affected my life: just try getting up 40-60 extra minutes earlier for brushing in the morning, or braiding your hair whenever you are going to have sex, otherwise you might as well go and shave your head afterwards.<br />Surely I didn't expect Tangle Teezer to completely solve this problem, but in my situation even slight improvements make a difference.<br />So when I tried it for the first time, I was in tears again, as I always am when I brush my hair. But this time my tears were happy. I just couldn't believe this nightmare ended, once and for all. It's like I've grown different hair. Dry, wet, tangled as a mop, it makes no difference - I am able to detangle it in just a couple of strokes, with my eyes closed and hands tied.<br />That is simply unbelievable for me. I've recommended it to all my friends, who were perfectly aware of how bad it was for me, and will buy more, just because I can't think of getting back to my previous routine if I somehow lose this brush.<br />I am including an old picture where you can see what my hair looks like just so you understand what I'm talking about.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+KIIDHRzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+KIIDHRzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+KIIDHRzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0045U707M,B01EY96W72,AE2KL6PX2PCYOMBASV4PMVLDID4A,2014-12-26 11:18:59.000,34,True

My hair is hip length (and unless my hair gets super dirty or I do cardio more often), I wash my hair once or twice a week.

It took forever, hurt a bit, and I’d end up “shedding” a good deal. On a whim I purchased this, and I’m only sad that I literally didn’t purchase it sooner. No detangling spray needed. Minimal shedding. And it takes only a few minutes (maybe two - and that’s probably an exaggeration) to comb through my hip length hair. For $9 it’s a steal.

The fist time I used it, it slid through my knotted hair like butter. The no tangle effect lasted for hours! If your brush tugs on you hair, or breaks when you brush it, or have a child that hates to get it's hair brushed because it hurts & pulls out hair, buy one. You will not be sorry. Granted, people lose 100 hairs per day on average, but this brush does not pull them out. You will notice less hair in the brush. It is not hard to clean either. At least with long hair you can grasp it or even kind of shake it over the trash & they just fall out!

Needless to say, by the time I finished running errands my hair had to returned to its natural state from the scalp to about 2 inches leaving the rest of my hair relatively straight.  When I returned home the thought of combing my hair through was discouraging.  I started with a comb which caused a lot of shedding and tearing.  Then I remembered my tangle teaser brush!

4,Perfect for my curly-haired dog,"I know it's not marketed for this, but I bought this brush to use on my dog, based on a recommendation from another dog owner with the same breed.  She was so emphatic in her recommendation that I felt I had to try it out!  He is part poodle, so his fur is very curly, and I've always found brushing him with a regular dog brush or comb to be somewhat cumbersome.  He's prone to little mats, and I felt like they would often get snagged on the other brush to the point where I was sometimes hurting my dog.  Not so with the tangle teezer!  It glides through his fur like a breeze.  And I can tell he enjoys being brushed by it.  He scoots right up to me and lets me brush away.  I think the rubber bristles have a massaging quality to them, so that I never feel bad about brushing my dog with it.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I don't think it works the best at getting the mats out of his fur.  You would probably still need a de-matter or some other comb for that purpose.  Although, if I stick to regular brushings, I imagine that will help prevent the mats in the first place.

I used to step out of the shower and thrown my hair up in a towel then air dry (I have very straight hair but I thought it was slightly wavy because I would let it dry in a mangled mess thus it would dry wavy) since getting this brush, it is safe to use on wet hair so I started to brush my hair after a shower and my hair looks so different! Before it was slightly wavy and frizzy, but now it is straight and sleek because it can dry straight now. I even had a male friend ask me if I did something to my hair because it is so straight now, and guys usually don't notice stuff like that. It goes through my hair super easy and gets all the knots out.
