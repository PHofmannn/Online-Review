4,A Showcase of Lessons Learned and Love Lost - A Cry of a Soul in Emotional Torment!,"Over the years I've heard many Adele songs and she always seemed to be singing about one man from a long time ago that she seemed to have a hard time getting over. In this one she is again singing about men, men who do not appreciate her for the beautiful soul she is. My one thought after listening to this CD is that Adele needs to fall in love with God, not another man! Her soul is craving the unconditional love only God can give her. A man should be second place to God.<br /><br />Many of the songs on this album are like therapy sessions where she is talking about her issues, even crying openly. I admit it is somewhat difficult to listen to unless you've been through depression and can relate. As someone who has fallen in love and been hurt in the past I know human love in a relationship falls short of most people's expectations.<br /><br />One thing I did consider is that this CD is like a warning for people who listen to it. The lyrics about just wanting to have fun even when something is not right is a huge red flag. It shows what can happen to people when they have this attitude and don't consider their spiritual health. Everyone makes mistakes!<br /><br />The battle between the heart and mind can lead a person to a state that is not pleasant to live in. Either Adele has learned this valuable lesson or she will make more albums with her pain. Yes, it is hard to try, we all can relate. But she can be free an happy again if she focuses more on God and less on men to satisfy the cry of her emotional torment.<br /><br />My copy was also cracked on the front and it was sent in a box! So not sure why all these copies are cracked! Maybe it is symbolic like something is broken. A heart!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2021-12-05 20:23:04.347,9,True,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"over the year i have hear many adele song and she always seem to be singe about one man from a long time ago that she seem to have a hard time get over . in this one she be again singe about man , man who do not appreciate she for the beautiful soul she be . my one think after listen to this cd be that adele need to fall in love with god , not another man ! her soul be crave the unconditional love only god can give she . a man should be second place to god.<br /><br />many of the song on this album be like therapy session where she be talk about her issue , even cry openly . i admit it be somewhat difficult to listen to unless you have be through depression and can relate . as someone who have fall in love and be hurt in the past i know human love in a relationship fall short of most people 's expectations.<br /><br />one thing i do consider be that this cd be like a warning for people who listen to it . the lyric about just want to have fun even when something be not right be a huge red flag . it show what can happen to people when they have this attitude and do not consider their spiritual health . everyone make mistakes!<br /><br />the battle between the heart and mind can lead a person to a state that be not pleasant to live in . either adele have learn this valuable lesson or she will make more album with her pain . yes , it be hard to try , we all can relate . but she can be free an happy again if she focus more on god and less on man to satisfy the cry of her emotional torment.<br /><br />my copy be also crack on the front and it be send in a box ! so not sure why all these copy be crack ! maybe it be symbolic like something be break . a heart!<br /><br />~the rebecca review",year hear adele song singe man long time ago hard time get singe man man appreciate beautiful soul think listen cd adele need fall love god man soul crave unconditional love god man second place song album like therapy session talk issue cry openly admit somewhat difficult listen depression relate fall love hurt past know human love relationship fall short people thing consider cd like warning people listen lyric want fun right huge red flag show happen people attitude consider spiritual health make battle heart mind lead person state pleasant live adele learn valuable lesson album pain yes hard try relate free happy focus god man satisfy cry emotional copy crack send box sure copy crack maybe symbolic like break rebecca review,4

5,what's with all the hate???,"To be honest, upon my initial attempt to listen to this album, I was not in the proper space to give it my full attention and I just skipped through the tracks to see if anything immediately stood out. I usually Never do that and I will sit through most things a few times before I formulate any sort of opinion.  Having a long commute to a job, I finally had the chance to listen to it and after Several listens, I Love the album. For those of you that think it's too sad, etc., I'm sorry to say, but this is Art and sometimes what inspires the work isn't always rainbows and sunshine. It's unfortunate that there seems to be so many persons whom would so quickly dismiss the artist because it's not what they wanted to hear. That's a pretty immature thought process and y'all should check yourselves because I'm not here writing a review of your albums or critiquing any of your art. if any of you were truly artists, you would not be saying the things that you are. Everyone is entitled to have an opinion, but just because you may not enjoy something does not meant it is not good. Just some food for thought.  I'd give the album a few more spins before talking smack. I consume all types of music, mostly heavier things. Things that the common person would probably have to wear a diaper to listen to. This album has made my list of favorite releases of the year some of which are Rivers of Nihil - The Work, Whitechapel - Kin, Spiritbox - Eternal Blue, Archspire - Bleed the Future,  Brand of Sacrifice - Lifeblood, Born of Osiris - Angel or Alien, Gojira - Fortitude, Darko US - Darko,  Slaughter to Prevail - Kostolom, Vildhjarta - Masstaden Under Vatten, just to name a few.

1,"Dreary, confused & self-indulgent","Each of Adele’s albums shows a stage in her development: ‘19’ shows that she’s a fantastic singer with a unique voice. ‘21’ was focused on channeling this voice into great, memorable songs. ‘25’ created an entire album that felt like a cohesive effort, not just great songs but put together in a way that flows and comes off almost like a concept album.<br />‘30’ actually IS a concept album: it’s about divorce (specifically her own) with all the dreariness, loneliness  and regret that comes with it. Handling this concept shouldn’t be beyond Adele’s considerable range of talents. On previous albums, she expresses these feelings excellently through well-crafted, memorable songs.<br />Unfortunately, on ‘30’ she doesn’t.<br />The relentless grimness isn’t really the problem- it’s the songs themselves. Stylistically, it mostly goes between meandering jazzy noodling (with barely a trace of the strong melody that makes even her most subtle tunes stay with the listener) with a weird trio of bouncy, almost disco-esque tracks right in the middle that feel like they’re from a completely different album, and finishes with a few ballady songs that feel like they’re going to take off into something special but never do. Much of it feels unfinished, like these are demos instead of a finished album.  There’s also a over reliance on backing vocal tracks, some of which sound like they might be Adele’s own voice auto-tuned to different pitches and overdubbed. However it’s done, it sells her otherwise extraordinary voice short. Because of this, the lead-off single ‘Go Easy On Me’ us by far the best track on the album: it’s  focused on her voice. In fact, it’s the only really memorable, single-worthy track on the whole thing.<br />The best songs from her previous efforts have a universal quality to them: you can imagine people jamming them decades from now, the way people still love the classics from the 50’s and 60’s.  There’s nothing on ‘30’ that feels like it would have that kind of staying power. The pain here is specific: life-changing tragedy can make you feel confused and bleak, and this album is successful at that.  The problem is that it’s not a pleasant place to be, and it doesn’t make for a good listen. Adele is trying to make you feel what she felt, but it’s not cathartic in any way because  the lack of strong songwriting mires it down. Thus, it feels like a confused muddle with little to connect the emotion behind the song to the listener.<br />And that makes it come off as self-indulgent. The bits where she talks to her son and mumbles about being hungover make it feel even more so. It’s like we’re reading Adele’s diary- it’s probably helpful to her, but there’s a reason why most people’s diaries don’t get published. They’re not for everyone; they’re for the person who wrote them and not for anyone else.<br />What also hurts the whole effort is that it took so long to come out. After 6 years, we were hoping for something better.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AELIXEW7IX6LD3MJT2DOQCEYZZDQ,2021-12-20 19:34:07.408,1,False,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"each of adele ’s album show a stage in her development : ' 19 ' show that she ’ a fantastic singer with a unique voice .

3,Easy on her!,"Undoubtedly one of the most anticipated music comeback releases this year (ABBA's Voyage being the other one), the UK's premium songbird after 6 years of absence returned with easily her most personal and experimental set. Adele's 4th offering is drenched in heartbreak, and addressing parenthood, a failed marriage, and self-discovery; pretty depressive and downbeat then, but this is Adele, what are really the chances of her coming up with dancefloor bops and club anthems?<br /><br />""Love is a game"" is the only true standout on 30, where the biggest highlight remains that towering voice that makes even mediocre material sound important. After 3 listens I feel partly disappointed, partly surprised (some Amy Winehouse vibes in her delivery are so welcome to witness). I feel that Adele this time around made more of an effort to improve her looks rather than her craft. Perhaps my expectations are high due to her long absence, I just want my divas to shine to Whitney level if possible!<br /><br />I chose the white vinyl variant, a wonderful 2LP set with 2 jackets (no gatefold), and also preordered the 16-page hmv CD with slightly alternate cover artwork.

3,HighwaytoBackinBlackHellWeSaluteYou.,"AC/DC are hell bent on repetition. Put ""Power Up"" in with their other albums and mix thoroughly. There's nothing to see here. Keep walking.

4,and the band rocks on....,"AC/DC - Power Up (Columbia)<br />A new release from this popular band sneaks in under the radar with classic rock radio being the cause.<br />Why is it that current bands like AC/DC only get their old material played? Even Top 40 radio played new releases.  But new material from bands that have their older songs highlighted on classic rock radio are never inserted into the rotation. This doesn’t make sense.<br />Oh, the new record.<br />AC/DC have a patented sound. Hard rock aka metal (although one doesn’t necessarily consider all hard rock to be metal), a pounding drum and bass line moves the power chords forward with Brian doing that wonderful screech of his with Angus doing leads, this album debuts twelve new tracks that are going to please fans of the band and people who like the crunch of rock/metal to begin with.<br />One cannot help but love Brian Johnson’s vocals. Sort of a cross between a raspy scream and a crow’s caw, it works so well in the context of this approach to rock, despite the seemingly unflattering description of his voice. His voice is pure emotion without any of the trimmings. Even more than Angus, his voice defines the band’s sound.<br />And the blend of the surviving Young brothers’ guitars, lead and rhythm (RIP Malcolm), also are the basis for AC/DC. Their angry loud and brash sound are the perfect accompaniment for Brian’s bird of prey coming down to snatch it’s victim vocals.<br />Not for the progressive-only minded, but definitely for the no frills rocker.<br />(4 stars out of 5)<br />MC Mahan",[],B08KGT79CH,B08KGT79CH,AF5IPNL5WTTROYA3TQTFTSLRVW2A,2021-07-22 22:47:18.844,0,True,Digital Music,POWER UP,4.8,28753,[],8.85,"ac / dc - power up ( columbia)<br />a new release from this popular band sneak in under the radar with classic rock radio be the cause.<br />why be it that current band like ac / dc only get their old material play ? even top 40 radio play new release .   but new material from band that have their old song highlight on classic rock radio be never insert into the rotation . this do not make sense.<br />oh , the new record.<br />ac / dc have a patent sound . hard rock aka metal ( although one do not necessarily consider all hard rock to be metal ) , a pound drum and bass line move the power chord forward with brian do that wonderful screech of his with angus do lead , this album debut twelve new track that be go to please fan of the band and people who like the crunch of rock / metal to begin with.<br />one can not help but love brian johnson ’s vocal . sort of a cross between a raspy scream and a crow ’s caw , it work so well in the context of this approach to rock , despite the seemingly unflattering description of his voice . his voice be pure emotion without any of the trimming . even more than angus , his voice define the band ’s sound.<br />and the blend of the survive young brother ’ guitar , lead and rhythm ( rip malcolm ) , also be the basis for ac / dc . their angry loud and brash sound be the perfect accompaniment for brian ’s bird of prey come down to snatch it ’ victim vocals.<br />not for the progressive - only minded , but definitely for the no frill rocker.<br />(4 star out of 5)<br />mc mahan",ac dc power new release popular band sneak radar classic rock radio current band like ac dc old material play radio play new release new material band old song highlight classic rock radio insert rotation new dc patent sound hard rock aka metal necessarily consider hard rock metal pound drum bass line move power chord forward brian wonderful screech angus lead album debut new track go fan band people like crunch rock metal begin help love brian johnson vocal sort cross raspy scream crow caw work context approach rock despite seemingly unflattering description voice voice pure emotion trimming angus voice define band blend survive young brother guitar lead rhythm rip malcolm basis ac dc angry loud brash sound perfect accompaniment brian bird prey come snatch victim progressive minded definitely frill star mahan,3

3,It's an AC/DC Album,"The legacy: Perhaps the biggest challenge AC/DC faces is that THIS band is Legend. Two hundred MILLION albums sold. Eighteen ALbums. All of them incredibly meaningful. They have never written a bad song (or a ballad) and they responsible for some of the MOST indelible riffs in rock. Whole Lotta Rosie, Problem Child, TNT, Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Let alone Thunderstruck. A legendary band, with a reborn frontman who is arguably one of the best ever. Angus is his usual awesome self. The rhythm section is solid. It is SO good to hear Brian back in form.<br /><br />The mythology is that before he passed, Malcolm and Angus wrote HUNDREDS of songs. Sort of like how Springsteen recorded dozens of songs then skimmed the cream for the Born In The USA package.<br /><br />The best way to summarize is: Not their bast album. Only one or two songs they would play live (what's THAT in these days of Covid?). Their live show is phenomenal. But it hasn't changed substantially since Live At Donington. Now, THAT is an essential listen.<br /><br />This one reflects their age and maturity. It's not the raw power of the past, but that's OK. It's a solid effort and IF it had been released by anyone else, it would be hailed as a masterpiece.

Most of it has the feel of ""Ballbreaker"" or ""Flick of the Switch"", but even ""Flick of the Switch"" closes with the up-tempo ""Brain Shake."" There is no way this is better than those two albums.

3,Utter Disappointment; Changed to Just OK,"This is my initial response after listening to the new CD once. I'm not impressed at all. In fact, I'm very disappointed in my purchase. Would not buy again, except that I have a collection of all her CDs. Not your typical Adele song style of power-house songs. If you're looking for mellow, whiny, sad, depressing songs this CD is for you. The only great song on the CD is ""Easy on Me,"" the only up-beat, close to power-house song on the CD. I hope this is not the direction that her future CDs go in the future. If so, I will not buy them. Very sadly disappointed. But I am taking a 2-hour road trip Monday and will listen to the CD again. Hopefully I will find some redeeming qualities in the songs, at least enough to have made the purchase worthwhile...<br />After listening on 2-hour road trip. There are some, 2-3, songs that are OK, but nothing spectacular that you would expect from Adele. This is her 2nd worst CD, next to 19. CDs 21 & 25 are awesome through and through.

2,Overpriced and depressing,"Like many, I have Adele's previous albums. When 30 was announced, I wasn't too keen on getting it. ""Same ol', slow, depressing music,"" I thought. But, I caved. My top 8 observations, in no particular order:<br /><br />8. Music - The first time I heard the album, I was excited. In addition to the classic Adele we all love, other tracks had an upbeat bluesy feel, and moments reminiscent of Motwown. (Though, a friend commented she hated the background singers on one of the tracks.) I wish it would have been pushed further. The music producing was questionable at times -- using her child's recorded conversation was the low point of the album for me, while Sides B and D were the highlights.<br /><br />7. Vinyl Presentation - Love the album cover. The white vinyl was cool, but why in the world did the art director make the label orange-yellow? It looks like an EGG. Aesthetically doesn't jive with the rest of the album visually or conceptually. Scratchin' my head on that one.<br /><br />6. Hits - While generally the songs were solid, there were no monsters on 30. 19 had ""Chasing Pavements,"" 21 had ""Someone Like You"", 25 had ""Hello."" Tough acts for ""Easy on Me"" to follow.<br /><br />5. Track arrangement - 3 songs per side over four sides was a real BUMMER. It’s supposedly for improved quality, but I would've much preferred killing two of the worst tracks and fitting everything all on one record.<br /><br />4. Commercial - Adele already allowed one of the songs, ""Hold On,"" for use in an Amazon commercial, I think before the album came out. If you want us to take your art seriously, maybe hold off on selling it for an advertisement? (""Hold On"" is a great song, btw. If it were bad, this wouldn't even be a point of contention.)<br /><br />3. Albums - I liked ""30"" third best of all her albums. For me it goes: 21, 19, 30, 25.<br /><br />2. Price - At $40, there was nothing to speak of in the way of extras. No booklet, gatefold insert, Autorip or downloadable code...nothing. What poor value. By contrast, Coldplay's Music of the Spheres had all those things, plus BTS and Selena Gomez, for 22 bucks.<br /><br />1. Most music, I wanna hang out with at a certain point in time, depending on mood. Adele's ""30"" is more like being stuck in a 2-hour brunch with an acquaintance who's going on about her divorce. At least it felt like 2 hours. Google says the album runtime was 58 minutes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HVTKLPQ,B09HVRTMFX,AHOQVDAF6N6TEQQW5TM572JZXVQA,2021-11-30 18:28:52.957,8,True,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"like many , i have adele 's previous album . when 30 be announce , i be not too keen on get it .

""Oh My God"" hits a groove similar to her previous releases.  ""Can I Get It,"" Track 6, shifted my attitude about ""30.""  Her vocals flow seamlessly as she swirls in desire for a lover.  ""I Drink Wine"" moves back into therapy mode where she seems to realize alcohol is not a solution.  ""Woman Like Me"" sways softly as she sadly dismisses a lazy lover.  It takes about two minutes on ""To Be Loved"" before Adele belts her heart out, ""Let it be known that I'm trying.""  ""Love Is A Game"" closes this standard edition (deluxe has additional tracks) as Adele is a disillusioned lover.  This is a broken heart record.

The single, ""Easy On Me"", appeals to her heartbreaking divorce and other challenges - sparing any whininess.  It sets the tone for what follows.  On each of these twelve songs, Adele's singing demonstrates that she's not nodding off at the microphone.  The emotional risks she's feeling is evident in every note and there's a fine rapport between her and the musicians.  Most autobiographically moving are ""My Little Love"", ""I Drink Wine"" and ""Woman Like Me"".  With this record, Adele has brought out a touch of poetry born out of distress, if not chaos, for the first time.  But she allows herself room for self-forgiveness.

3,Great Songs by the Queen of Pop Rock...disappointing vinyl pressing - lots of pops and ticks.,"Okay, as far as the music and vocals go...it's Adele...nothing else needs said. Most of the songs are superb. Are there a couple of songs less than superb? Yes maybe a couple. Let's face it you can't hit a home run on every song, but Adele comes very close to doing just that. With that said, if you are going to release a double LP, have enough material to fill 2 LPs or at least make it a 45 rpm album with wider grooves. Wider grooves = better sound quality. 3 songs per side just means more interruptions to the listening experience with no apparent gains in quality. Also for her first release on Columbia records, you would think they would have gone the extra mile to put out a better quality product. There were a lot of scrap shavings still on the edges of the records and the edges are sharp enough to cut you (or cut through the inner sleeves) if not handled carefully. The sound quality is acceptable except for the numerous pops and ticks throughout all sides of the record, again probably caused by excess material that was not cleaned from the records properly after they were pressed (shame on the stamping plant). Even after ultrasonically cleaning both LPs before the first play, both records are VERY noisy. Fortunately I have a method of removing the pops and ticks. I just shouldn't have to on a new record.<br />So, is it worth buying Adele's newest release on vinyl? Yes, just stay clear of the white vinyl issue and opt for the black. Maybe you'll have better luck.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HVTKLPQ,B09HVRTMFX,AEJLPB2IZKPAKYCP2MK4AI3E6FIQ,2021-11-20 22:18:21.741,21,True,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"okay , as far as the music and vocal go ... it be adele ... nothing else need say . most of the song be superb . be there a couple of song less than superb ? yes maybe a couple . let us face it you can not hit a home run on every song , but adele come very close to do just that . with that say , if you be go to release a double lp , have enough material to fill 2 lp or at least make it a 45 rpm album with wide groove . wider groove = well sound quality . 3 song per side just mean more interruption to the listening experience with no apparent gain in quality . also for her first release on columbia record , you would think they would have go the extra mile to put out a well quality product . there be a lot of scrap shaving still on the edge of the record and the edge be sharp enough to cut you ( or cut through the inner sleeve ) if not handle carefully . the sound quality be acceptable except for the numerous pop and tick throughout all side of the record , again probably cause by excess material that be not clean from the record properly after they be press ( shame on the stamping plant ) . even after ultrasonically clean both lp before the first play , both record be very noisy . fortunately i have a method of remove the pop and tick . i just should not have to on a new record.<br />so , be it worth buy adele 's new release on vinyl ? yes , just stay clear of the white vinyl issue and opt for the black . maybe you will have well luck .",okay far music vocal adele need say song superb couple song superb yes maybe couple let face hit home run song adele come close say go release double lp material fill lp rpm album wide groove wider groove well sound quality song mean interruption listening experience apparent gain quality release columbia record think go extra mile well quality product lot scrap shaving edge record edge sharp cut cut inner sleeve handle carefully sound quality acceptable numerous pop tick side record probably cause excess material clean record properly press shame stamping plant ultrasonically clean lp play record noisy fortunately method remove pop tick new worth buy adele new release vinyl yes stay clear white vinyl issue opt black maybe well luck,2

4,"This album is brilliant, and very different.","This album is really incredible and has a different feel than Adele's other albums. To me, it has a very retro feel.  I hear a lot of songs with melodies and instrumentation that go back to the '50s and '60s. One track even features Errol Garner on the piano of a song he wrote (""All Night Parking"" that Adele added some lyrics to.  The first track, 'Strangers By Nature"" is gorgeous, and reminds me of a Burt Bacharach song, like something I'd hear on the radio or on a TV Special in the '50s or '60s.  I hear this ""Bacharach"" type of song on other tracks as well, and that is a big compliment. To be compared to Burt Bacharach, one of the greatest composers ( along with Hal David) ever, is one of the best things I can say about Adele and this album.  There are a few upbeat tracks, ""Can I Get It"", a more current sounding track, ""Cry Your Heart Out"", and ""Oh My God"".  One of the best tracks is ""My Little Love"", which is dedicated to her young son, and it includes recordings of her chatting with her son about how she is feeling during a divorce. It will make you cry. It's a beautiful song.  I love that this album has a Retro feel, and also includes some jazz elements and pop elements of the '50s and '60s.

5,The Only Good Thing to Come out of 2020,"The Good-  These songs are tight, layered, and surprisingly melodic.  Brian Johnson sounds great here.  Somehow, he sounds better here than he did 20-30 years ago.  The album gives him more to do vocally and gives the album a freshness to it.  AC/DC of course never loses its trademark sound while expanding their range a bit.  The lyrics are the best they've written since Ballbreaker.  The mixing is much better than Rock or Bust as now you can clearly hear Brian Johnson's vocals. Angus and company are, as usual, on point with their playing.<br /><br />The Bad-  It appears they have scaled back on the guitar solos a bit.  I would have preferred some of them to a bit longer.  This is a minor gripe and it's all I got for anything negative to say about this album.<br /><br />The Deal-  This album is a great rebound from the forgettable Rock or Bust.  More importantly, a worthy tribute to the late great Malcom Young.  This year has been a train wreck with no survivors.  PWR UP is the only saving grace from this miserable year.

5,Best Since Razor’s Edge,"Back in the day, before I was even in my teens, I owned Highway to Hell, Back in Black, and For Those About to Rock on vinyl. Needless to say, I was a huge AC/DC fan. They lost the mojo, IMO, with a string of less than stellar albums. Then, Razor’s Edge came out in 1990 and they were BACK!  Or so I thought. Again, another string of less than stellar albums. None bad, but none great, either. So, when I heard Powerup was coming out, I was glad to hear it, but wasn’t expecting much. Let me just say, this album has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. Like, by a mile. I haven’t been able to stop listening to this since I got it. Not a bad song on here and quite a few great ones. I find myself with a different song stuck in my head every day.

2,Not the same Adele quality to which we're accostomed and not for every Adele fan for sure.,"If you are reading the reviews of ""30"" I imagine you are familiar with Adele and most likely her ""21"" and ""25"" releases. They were both, well, simply phenomenal recordings. On 25, in particular, almost every song could stand on its own merit and had top 10 potential. The songwriting and the singing were spectacular in my book. And, while not audiophile quality by any stretch, the recording was pretty good too.  After 5 years, she released this album, which as you can read in many reviews here and elsewhere, has not been met with nearly as much enthusiasm, and I can certainly see why and don't disagree.<br /><br />Many musicians, once they've reached a level of critical success and, dare I say, fame and fortune, will deviate from what made them that way in order to pursue their artistic interest and creativity. I don't know if that is the case here, as she doesn't seem to have written these songs for the most part. But it is certainly a departure from what made 21 and especially 25 tremendous commercial successes.  Lyrically I expect these offerings will find great acclaim from the emo crowd perhaps. And, Adele being the musical powerehouse that she is, may have just created a whole new genre called Blues Pop, or something of that ilk. It's got to be hard to have so much talent, fame and money at such a young age, so when troubles in life that are common to most of us come your way,  it feels like the world is imploding around you. The fact is that emotionally healthy individuals find ways to deal with the imperfect people, lives and world in which we all  exist. This album must be her way of dealing with it. It worked for the great blues artists of the 20th century, and certainly for the Country and Western genre artists as well. Pretty much every one of these songs is her lamenting failed love and life in some form or fashion and one can't help feeling down after listening to them. At least I couldn't. There is no message in these songs that I particularly enjoy or even want to hear, let alone listen to over and over like I do 21 and 25. On My Little Love, for example, she is singing to her child, who presumably is the one singing with her as well. She speak-sings to them about how depressed she is, hard her life is and that she is hung over really badly. Ugh, I pity the child if she is really like this.<br /><br />Stylistically, well it is all over the place too, although that's not always a bad thing. Artists mature, evolve and find ways to keep their material innovative, fresh and interesting. But here, well, it fails to accomplish any of that for me. Some songs sound like something out of the 1940's or 1950's  (Strangers by Nature), others somewhat modern, like her signature pop soul style, and others, well I'm not sure what you would call it. Sometimes her voice sounds forced and anything but engaging on several songs. There are some weird, and even unpleasant soul ding back up vocals (Cry Your Heart Out for example) that make the songs ones that will always earn a skip when, or if, I listen to the CD again. Yet as varied as the styles are, it kind of all sounds kinda the same too, which us odd.<br /><br />Sonically, it is not a particularly good recording. It probably sounds ok with in ear monitors/ear buds, and is perhaps made better with binaural or spatial audio, but on a decent stereo system it falls really flat. Imaging is indistinct, clarity is dull, dynamics are blunted. The recording is lackluster, sounding very compressed like an under-engineered pop effort that could have been made in a mediocre Y**Tub* producer’s living room. There is no sparkle, foot tapping, hand raising ooohing and aaahhhing over the sonics for me. It just sounds poor on my home stereo. No big loss though,  as it turns out.<br /><br />So what is left to be said? Well, evidently Adele wanted to tell the world how miserable she is over her failed relationship(s), family struggles and overall miserable state of being. If so, she accomplished it in spades. I've listened to it four times through, once even with a musician friend who wouldn't even finish the CD with me.<br />However, there are a couple of good songs  thankfully. Easy On Me and Woman Like Me both are good enough for me to add a second star to my overall rating, for me at least. But, they aren't good enough for me to want to listen to the entire work again, sadly.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if this album stands the test of time or be a flop. No artist gets it right every time and I will certainly grant her some grace by waiting another block of time to see if she overcomes this morose outlook on life to come up with another musically and lyrically decent, or even great, album. I'll be setting this one aside to collect dust in the meantime. Obviously I'm just not the target audience she had in mind with this effort like I may have been for her previous releases, and that's fine. I'm just throwing out my thoughts for others to consider before subjecting themselves to these songs. You may want to borrow or stream this one before purchasing.

3,"A fun album, no duds, no standouts","This album is a solid 41 minutes of music. The production is okay, but nothing like Back in Black or even Razors Edge. The mix doesnt have a kick to it and Johnson's vocals get raised or dropped in the mix depending on the song. The songs are even. Unlike Black Ice that had strong standouts like Rock N Roll Train or War Machine versus total missus like Big Jack, this album feels steady. That's a good thing and a bad thing at the same type.<br /><br />The songs do offer a decent variety but some repeats.<br /><br />Realize has a tamer Thunderstruck vibe. A chanting background  with a decent hook.<br />Rejection is a good one that has that Black Ice feel to it. I'd swear this one is from that album<br />Shot In The Dark has a nice kick to it. Short and fast with some chanting to it.<br />Through The Mists of Time is different from the rest of the album I like the lyrics and the rhythm here. Problem the biggest departure from the norm.<br />Kick You When You're Down is another different one. It has that start-stop to the beat like something you might find on Highway To Hell. I like this one as well.<br />Witch's Spell is a tight rocker.<br />Demon Fire is a great song but it's Caught With Your Pants Down basically with new lyrics. I like the updated version here.<br />Wild Reputation is a bluesy tune with a decent Angus cut.<br />No Man's Land is even more bluesy and it works really here. Another favorite of mine. It has Malcolm all over it.<br />Systems Down should have been the album finisher. It builds steam and is a good track.<br />Money Shot is not what you might think. It's not filler, it's not crude and it features my favorite Angus solo on the album.<br />Code Red is another excellent track. The second side is very, very solid and really the order can be debated but this is a good album ending.<br /><br />The final three songs remind me of the George Young (and Vanda) days where the guitars stand out above everything else. Like something like Show Business or another track from before Let There Be Rock.<br /><br />Is this album among the best? Of course not. It compares to Ballbreaker, Stiff Upper Lip, Black Ice and Rock Or Bust. The hard riffs found on Flick of the Switch or Fly On The Wall (other less than favorable albums) are not present but the album isnt as slow as Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />The hardest part about the album is there are only a handful of total minutes where Angus cuts loose and that's the main reason to listen to the album.<br /><br />I can see this album sitting above Stiff Upper Lip, Rock or Bust and maybe even with Black Ice but below Razors Edge.

Can’t stand the background singers. Here’s hoping on her next album Adele goes back to just her singing the songs. Listened to this maybe four times and haven’t heard it since.

5,Adele Matures and Experience Heartbreak at 30,"REVIEW OF ADELE'S ""30.""<br /><br />You know folks. I'm a throwback to the 60s, 70s, and 80s. As the years go by I become more disenchanted with what modern music has become, or where it's going.<br /><br />However, only a few modern artists stands out to me and Adele tops that list.<br /><br />For the last decade Adele's music could be heard on my digital streaming devices at home or in my ears via Amazon Music or Tidal.<br /><br />The amount of blockbuster hits that Adele has under her belt is staggering for an artist who hasn't even reached 30...until recently when she actually hit the big 3 0.<br /><br />Adele herself is a throwback..well kind of. A case can be made for her to be the Barbara Streisand and Celine Dion of her generation.<br /><br />So I was skeptical reading all of the reviews of her new studio album which was released today. The critics praised this album as her best ever...Rolling Stone music journalist Rob Sheffield called 30 Adele's ""toughest, most powerful album yet"" with the best vocal performances of her career, and praised its ""deft"" production by her collaborators. Neil McCormick, in his review for The Daily Telegraph, hailed 30 as her strongest record yet, containing ""powerhouse"" songs with ""intense"" emotions and ""bravura"" performances. Emma Swann of DIY described the album as ""raw and uncompromising"", matching cinematic music with lyrics on ""the pain, the self-flagellation, the hope, the acceptance of things gone horribly wrong.""<br /><br />I gave the album a whirl this morning and it quintessential Adele..but with a kick. Adele doesn't change her formula of being the queen of heartbreak songs but embraces it. In a world for artists to keep changing their formula to stay on top, Adele doesn't go that route.<br /><br />Instead, Adele shows maturity and reflection on life in an album that places her emotions center stage, and in your face . There is nothing pretentious or sugar coated on these songs. It's a woman spilling her sorrows out in her artistic craft.<br /><br />30 has everything you want from Adele...anger, sadness, hopelessness, being pensive and being afraid of change.<br /><br />I wouldn't say 30 is her best album, but I will say that the songs are definitely her most personal and can appeal to anyone who is going through traumatic heartbreak or who has experienced loss in his or her lifetime.<br /><br />Adele and her buttery voice clearly shines on 30. For us old timers,, it's good to see that Adele can write songs that appeals to multi generational listeners, instead of appealing to a more marketable group of the youth of today.<br /><br />In conclusion,  Adele 30 is a snapshot into an artist's real life, eschewing the glamor of being a superstar. Adele proves that her voice and the topics she sings about are timeless and will be remembered in years to come as being classics like Streisand or Dion.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AHTFE4GQI2J2FZLNFBRTCAMMQGDQ,2021-11-19 15:22:55.150,4,False,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"review of adele 's "" 30.""<br /><br />you know folk . i be a throwback to the 60 , 70 , and 80 . as the year go by i become more disenchanted with what modern music have become , or where it be going.<br /><br />however , only a few modern artist stand out to i and adele top that list.<br /><br />for the last decade adele 's music could be hear on my digital streaming device at home or in my ear via amazon music or tidal.<br /><br />the amount of blockbuster hit that adele have under her belt be stagger for an artist who have not even reach 30 ... until recently when she actually hit the big 3 0.<br /><br />adele herself be a throwback .. well kind of . a case can be make for she to be the barbara streisand and celine dion of her generation.<br /><br />so i be skeptical read all of the review of her new studio album which be release today . the critic praise this album as her good ever ... roll stone music journalist rob sheffield call 30 adele 's "" tough , most powerful album yet "" with the good vocal performance of her career , and praise its "" deft "" production by her collaborator . neil mccormick , in his review for the daily telegraph , hail 30 as her strong record yet , contain "" powerhouse "" song with "" intense "" emotion and "" bravura "" performance . emma swann of diy describe the album as "" raw and uncompromising "" , match cinematic music with lyric on "" the pain , the self - flagellation , the hope , the acceptance of thing go horribly wrong .

5,throwback to 19,"Adele told James Corden that ""25"" would be her last album named after her age because she ""believes in trilogies,"" so I am glad she did not hold herself to that. She being a year older than me, her albums keep coming (within a day or two of my birthday no less) in a way that makes me feel we are on a journey together.

5,"Not as radio-friendly, but possibly her most impressive album","30 isn't as full of simple radio-friendly ballads and barn-burners as 21 and, to a lesser extent, 19 and 25; I imagine this is the main reason for the fairly high percentage of one-star reviews here. But I personally found this to be Adele's most musically diverse, vocally impressive album to date. The subject matter is more complicated, the lyrics are more personal, and the moments of musical experimentation are more abundant than in her earlier efforts. But this is a pro rather than a con in my variety-loving mind, and Adele has never sounded better - certainly a relief given her significant weight loss and history of vocal problems.

3,Adele forgot to . . .,"While Olivia Rodrigo was burning up the charts with Sour and its Adele-on-steroids self-pity ditties, Adele teased her fans with a rumored, then definite, November release date for her post-“Hello” greeting, along with an extended promotional TV appearance.  However, the fact that it’s been six years since 25 -- a lifetime in the music biz – may have weakened 30’s sales performance a bit, as its first-week sales of 838,000 units were 25% less than what 25 had earned.  Adele’s extended absence and some of the different musical directions taken on 30 have apparently left at least a few fans – rumour has it -- underwhelmed.  A cardinal rule of successful songwriting is the provision of lyrics with enough gauzy edges that most everyone hearing the song can relate to it in some way.  Not Adele – 30 is her own private catharsis around her divorce – including a confessional conversation with her young son, complete with sobs and sniffles (“My Little Love”).  Party on, Ms. Adkins!  While the album does have some strong tracks – the blue-light jazz of “Strangers by Nature;” the girl-group gossip of “Cry Your Heart Out;” the soul ballad “Love Is a Game” – there are no barn-burners, no rolls in the deep.  30 has too many ballads, too much bathos, and far too many meandering songs without memorable hooks.

5,ADELE DID IT AGAIN! GREAT ALBUM FOR DIVORCED MOTHERS!,"This album is amazing and so versatile! Adele takes on jazz, r&b, pop, a bit of country influence, and her usual signature piano ballads. This record reminds me a lot of Amy Winehouse with lots of jazz influence! This is Adele’s BEST record yet and I am so happy I have this.<br /><br />As a recently divorced mother, I can relate to Adele’s pain. I love the songs, “I Drink Wine” and “To Be Loved” as they remind me of my own divorce that just occurred 6 months ago. I am drinking rosè and have had to go to CVS to get more tissues. I am also going to the liquor store later to get another bottle of liquor — but this time something stronger like vodka.

1,"Horrible Quality, Bad Songs","I was so excited to purchase this record because I love Adele's music, but I was extremely disappointed for multiple reasons:<br /><br />First of all, right out of the box, there were unremovable marks all over the record that caused several skips and repeated sections, making the vinyl extremely annoying to play. There were also inconsistencies in the plastic edges of the vinyls that looked extremely cheaply made and unprofessional.<br /><br />I was also extremely disappointed with Adele's album itself. To put it plainly, the music (except for Easy On Me) is absolute garbage. She recorded herself talking and saying things like ""mummy's had a rough day"" or ""tell me you love me"" throughout her songs. I don't want to listen to that haha.<br /><br />Most of the other songs are extremely muffled by loud instrumentals that lack any real melody. Her old songs used to have actual melodies, but these songs have hardly any actual structure. They're just bad.<br /><br />The only song I like is Easy On Me.

Great song that stands up to anything on her last two offereings. Then I got the CD and popped in the stereo. WTF?<br /><br />My first impression was awful.  I read several comments from others who agreed. I gave it one more listen. Still the same impressions.  Then Rolling Stone came out with a glorious review. WTF. Did I miss something? So I sat down and listened, intently to the dozen songs again. For the third (and last time). OMG it's horrible.  Here is my review:<br /><br />STRANGERS BY NATURE:  A funeral dirge that sounds more like a Christmas Carol than an upbeat pop song.  Grade:  C<br /><br />EASY ON ME: Great song, up to the quality of her previous offerings. Grade: A<br /><br />MY LITTLE LOVE: Written for her son Angelo who appears on the track at the end asking mommy why she be so sad. Sounds more like a 911 call to a suicide line than a song.  Grade: C-<br /><br />CRY YOUR HEART OUT: I wanted to, listening to this song. She moans through several verses interrupted by a weird electronically altered chorus bringing her grade down from an ""album filler"" B- to  a C.<br /><br />OH MY GOD:  That's the name of the song, and my reaction as well. OMG!  Is this an Adele song or an R&B (Retch & Barf) track? ""Hmm hmm yeah,"" more like Uh...uh...no. Something from the 1950's piano lounge singers.<br /><br />CAN I GET IT :Nice beginning, good beat, things are looking up. Grade: B+<br /><br />I DRINK WINE:  No kidding. Another slow dirge. Where's the fire in this rain? And the ending....WTF spoken word. Piano Lounge Lizard again. Grade: B-<br /><br />ALL NIGHT PARKING:  Lizard is gettng tired,  and so am I having to listen to this drivel.  On life support . Grade: C<br /><br />WOMAN LIKE ME:  BORRRRRING. Lounge lizard just died.<br /><br />HOLD ON: So quiet sounds like the neighbor in the house next door singing...drunk.  Someone needs a little Xanax.<br /><br />TO BE LOVED: God no! Not another funeral dirge?!  C-<br /><br />LOVE IS A GAME: Strings! OMG NO!  Has she risen to the point the sychophants around her are building her up at the expense of good music?  This album is awful.  Will not listen to it again or even take up space in my collection.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AFY2VCXZ5LJ2EB6X34TNHJ7LOEBA,2022-01-14 01:59:56.510,0,True,Digital Music,30,4.6,39104,[],7.27,"so we all wait with restless anticipation for adele 's next album . a teaser come out with release of "" easy on i "" and excitement grow . great song that stand up to anything on her last two offereing . then i get the cd and pop in the stereo . wtf?<br /><br />my first impression be awful .   i read several comment from other who agree . i give it one more listen . still the same impression .   then rolling stone come out with a glorious review . wtf . do i miss something ? so i sit down and listen , intently to the dozen song again . for the third ( and last time ) . omg it be horrible .   here be my review:<br /><br />strangers by nature :   a funeral dirge that sound more like a christmas carol than an upbeat pop song .   grade :   c < br /><br />easy on me : great song , up to the quality of her previous offering . grade : a < br /><br />my little love : write for her son angelo who appear on the track at the end ask mommy why she be so sad . sound more like a 911 call to a suicide line than a song .   grade : c-<br /><br />cry your heart out : i want to , listen to this song . she moan through several verse interrupt by a weird electronically altered chorus bring her grade down from an "" album filler "" b- to   a c.<br /><br />oh my god :   that be the name of the song , and my reaction as well . omg !   be this an adele song or an r&b ( retch & barf ) track ?

5,Adele is back!,I’ve waited for 6 years for the queen to return and man was it worth the wait. This album is one of Adele’s most emotional. I’ve always found myself in Adele’s music and this album is no different. The pressing of this vinyl is gorgeous and am so happy to have it in my collection. The vinyl arrived in a perfect package and is in great shape!

4,Loved this album!,"Throughout this album many of the songs are talking about Adele’s struggles during her divorce and  her journey in learning how to be a single parent. These songs are very passionate because Adele shares a lot of her emotions, states how she is feeling and even incorporates conversations between her and her daughter in the songs which all create a more passionate feeling. The mood is serious throughout the entire album, some of the lyrics even elicit a feeling of sadness. The entire album is recorded very well and fits very well with the instrumental in the background. Adele does stick to a slower more serious style of music in most of her songs and stuck to that throughout all of this album. The skit matched up with the music in most of the music videos because many of the videos were shot in black and white which emphasized the serious and sad tone portrayed throughout the songs. While I do not necessarily connect with these songs, it definitely triggers my emotions due to the serious tone portrayed throughout all of the songs in this album. I have listened to these songs on a deeper level and I feel like that enhances the effect when you are listening deeply and can really listen to the lyrics.

1,$33 for a single album?,"I love AC/DC, let there be no doubt of that, but charging 33 bucks for one single vinyl album is ridiculous.

5,A Masterpiece!,"This album hit me at age 55, like Back in Black hit me at age 15. When I 1st heard it I thought it was very, very good. When I heard it a 2nd time I thought it was Great! When I heard it for a 3rd time I thought it was a Masterpiece! The difference with albums like this and the run of the mill stuff, is that you immediately like a few of the catchy song, but the other songs never catch on; but on a great album such as this they all quickly grow on you and become favorites in their own way.  For me, I immediately liked Realize, Shot In the Dark, Kick You When You're Down, Demon Fire, Wild Reputation and Money Shot.  I liked all of the tracks but thought Rejection, and No Man's Land and Through the Mist of Time were the weakest tracks but now they are my current favorites.  And I have to say Through the Mist of Time is monumental and it is hard for me to not shed a tear or two thinking about Malcolm Young and all this band has been through and what they stand for!  I am not an audio technician but to my ears the sound on this album is phenomenal.  Brians voice is the best it has ever sounded, at least since Back in Black, and love the songs where he goes lower range, and Cliff, Phil, Stevie and of course Angus' playing is extraordinary and super tight. The really crazy thing about this album is that all the songs come across equally well on everything from my cell phone speakers, to the laptop speakers, to my car speakers, to my booming 9 x 190 watt home sound system. The sound is in a word ""explosive"", which it very well should be with an AC/DC album of this caliber!  I have the album on CD, deluxe CD,  yellow vinyl, black vinyl and loaded on every piece of digital audio equipment I own. 2020 just got a lot better.

Then in 2020 the unthinkable happened; the remaining group came back to create a modern day Back in Black. This album is a wonderful tribute to Malcolm.

5,Music that matched the 80s,"Incredible film.  There are so many movies that portray the 'odd ball' kid and as a teacher I see them all day.  This film was spot on to how I and probably many felt.  When he says he sees so much pain people are feeling, I totally understand.  It's overwhelming to him, as it is for most at this age.  From the Rocky Horror Picture Show to David Bowie (probably his best song never played - and I kept yelling ""Harmione, it's Bowie"") even to Air Supply, this movie is spot on to what kids (I) gravitated to growing up.
