Digital Music,Legend,4.8,22111,[],"[""Originally released in 1984, Bob Marley's LEGEND illustrates the remarkable life and recording career of one of reggae music's most important figures. This iconic collection not only serves as the perfect introduction to the music of Bob Marley, it has become an essential part in every Marley collection. It remains the world's best-selling reggae album and continues to be one of the best-selling catalog albums, exceeding 15 copies in the U.S. alone and over 27 million worldwide. Coupled with the original release of LEGEND on CD, this deluxe version features this iconic collection entirely mixed in 5.1 by the GRAMMY¬Æ Award winning producer Bob Clearmountain on Blu-Ray Pure Audio Disc‚Ñ¢ and now includes the original, early studio version of 'No Woman No Cry,' in lieu of the previous live version. Also featured are two, previously unheard alternate takes of 'Easy Skanking' and 'Punky Reggae Party' recently discovered in the Marley vault. Classic Marley anthems include 'Three Little Birds,' 'Get Up Stand Up,' 'One Love/People Get Ready,' 'No Woman No Cry' and 'I Shot The Sheriff,' which was later a No. 1 hit for Eric Clapton, as well as 'Jamming,' 'Exodus,' 'Redemption Song' and 'Is This Love.'PACKAGINGBoth the CD and Blu-Ray Pure Audio Disc‚Ñ¢ are housed in a 28-page, case bound book featuring extended liner notes, unseen photos and forewards written by Sir Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, and liner notes by author of the book Marley, Christopher Farley.""]",145.92,"[{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51z1MS8QFIL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51z1MS8QFIL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BQbPt3MaL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514rx6lM18L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514rx6lM18L.jpg', 'variant': 'BACK', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Jnrydw6-L._SL1060_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+q1J6+uWL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+q1J6+uWL.jpg', 'variant': 'RGHT', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JV+JhHVnL._SL1500_.jpg'}]",[],Bob Marley   Format: Audio CD,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Reggae', 'Rocksteady']","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '5.59 x 7.2 x 0.47 inches; 7.16 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Island', 'Item model number': '28931740', 'Date First Available': 'May 7, 2014', 'Label': 'Island', 'Country of Origin': 'France', 'Number of discs': '1'}",B00K6D20UE,,,

Digital Music,Legend,4.8,22007,[],"['Island 50th Anniversary Special Edition. There are few musicians whose music has indisputably advanced humanity. Reggae figurehead Bob Marley--a songwriter, poet, activist, and visionary--is one of them. The idea that a single-disc collection could represent the depth, breadth, and power of Marley\'s achievement is far-fetched, but LEGEND makes an excellent attempt. Every single one of its tracks is outstanding, and the artist\'s different faces--revolutionary (""Get Up Stand Up""), romantic (""Is This Love""), devout Rastafarian (""Buffalo Soldier""), and prophet (""One Love/People Get Ready"") are equally represented.In addition to his moving message of love and unity, Marley is a master songwriter, as the timelessness of songs like ""Stir It Up,"" ""I Shot the Sheriff,"" and the gorgeous, poignant ""Redemption Song"" proves. Of course, a true sampling of Marley\'s output would require some early ska material, the Wailer\'s debut (CATCH A FIRE), the definitive NATTY DREAD, and his later-period opus EXODUS, but LEGEND provides a highly satisfying, if brief, overview of Marley\'s genius. A record well suited to any location, season, or time of day, it has proven universal in its appeal. The music herein is as essential as air.

With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts"", ""There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple"", 'The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl', ""A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers"", ""The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs"", ""Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this"", 'The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli', ""An additional and unusual challenge was to ensure the proper playback of the sounds embedded in the 'lock-groove' at the end of side two of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP.""]",32.27,"[{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xlPHeg+eL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xlPHeg+eL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}]","[{'title': 'The Beatles: Vinyl Product Walkthrough', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/2df464237c05400486521a63ab2fdc40?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0', 'user_id': ''}, {'title': 'disappointing', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/df4a839a18614e8eac23a2ee4233d798?ref=dp_vse_rvc_1', 'user_id': 'AG7KBSJIUJVAWL5QORGWDNPK5B3Q'}, {'title': 'Great sound amazing quality ', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/828061c7cc354878bee2ddbf4ae7d198?ref=dp_vse_rvc_2', 'user_id': 'AGL7CS3NEJTKYXUCQCNLIP4SSAPQ'}]",The Beatles   Format: Vinyl,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Pop']","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '12.28 x 12.28 x 0.24 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'EMI', 'Item model number': 'abbey-road', 'Original Release Date': '2012', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.', 'Date First Available': 'January 23, 2011', 'Label': 'EMI', 'Number of discs': '1'}",B0041KVZ1I,,,

But this remastered, double-disc deluxe edition succeeds by offering up a generous, compelling portrait of that overly familiar musical triumph via 18 bonus tracks that include demos, outtakes, run-throughs, and studio jams. Stripping hits like ""Don\'t Stop,"" ""Go Your Own Way"" and ""Gold Dust Woman"" down to their most bare-bones form reveals the sturdy, elemental framework that tellingly lies beneath all the pop perfection. But tracks like Lindsey Buckingham\'s ebullient instrumental ""Brushes"" (the basic tracks of ""Never Going Back Again"") also display a musician whose focused vision is informed by accomplished playing that\'s anything but simple. The two brief studio jams included aren\'t much more than noisy, disposable fun. But other outtakes of songs that didn\'t make the album (Stevie Nicks\'s ""Think About It"" and ""Planets of the Universe""; Buckingham\'s ""Doesn\'t Anything Last"") help underscore the contention of Dave DiMartino\'s insightful new liner notes: This was a band on the cusp of triumph literally coming apart at its emotional seams, yet one which somehow channeled that personal turmoil into nothing short of epochal musical success.', '--Jerry McCulley']",23.65,"[{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZRWV913AL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZRWV913AL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': None}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PBXVhC0CL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PBXVhC0CL.jpg', 'variant': 'BACK', 'hi_res': None}]",[],Fleetwood Mac   Format: Audio CD,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classic Rock', 'Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)']","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.96 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 4.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Warner Bros.', 'Item model number': '1702611', 'Date First Available': 'July 26, 2006', 'Label': 'Warner Bros.', 'Number of discs': '2'}",B00009RAJI,,,

The Wall is the 11th studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in November 1979. It is the last studio album released with the line-up of guitarist David Gilmour, bass guitarist/lyricist Roger Waters, keyboardist Richard Wright, and drummer Nick Mason before Wright left the band. As with Pink Floyd's prior three albums, The Wall is a concept album, exploring themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It is a rock opera that follows Pink, a character whom Waters modelled after himself and the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Waters conceived the album during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he imagined a wall between the audience and the stage. The album was one of the best-selling of 1980, and by 1999 it had sold over 23 million RIAA-certified units, making it the third highest certified album in the United States.""]",37.95,"[{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Erzw86ULL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Erzw86ULL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gedR4Bl8L._SL1280_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DQUlAahSL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DQUlAahSL.jpg', 'variant': 'PT01', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618dEjkmcqL._SL1000_.jpg'}]",[],Pink Floyd   Format: Vinyl,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Pop']","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '12.1 x 12.2 x 0.4 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Pink Floyd Records', 'Item model number': '88875184281', 'Original Release Date': '2016', 'Run time': '1 hour and 21 minutes', 'Date First Available': 'July 30, 2016', 'Label': 'Pink Floyd Records', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}",B01L809INK,,,

Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band's cut-outs, and special inner bags for some of the titles"", ""The titles include The Beatles' 12 original UK albums, first released between 1963 and 1970, the US-originated Magical Mystery Tour, now part of the group's core catalogue, and Past Masters, Volumes One & Two, first released individually in 1988, featuring non-album A-sides and B-sides, EP tracks and rarities. With this release, The Beatles' first four albums make their North American stereo vinyl debuts"", ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band packaging includes replica psychedelic inner sleeve, cardboard cutout sheet and additional insert"", ""There has always been demand for The Beatles' albums on vinyl. Indeed, 2011's best-selling vinyl LP in the United States was Abbey Road. Following the success of The Beatles' acclaimed, GRAMMY Award-winning 2009 CD remasters, it was decided that the sound experts at EMI's Abbey Road Studios should create new versions of The Beatles' vinyl LPs. The project demanded the same meticulous approach taken for the CD releases, and the brief was a simple one: cut the digital remasters to vinyl with an absolute minimum of compromise to the sound. However, the process involved to do that was far from simple"", 'The first stage in transferring the sound of a master recording to vinyl is the creation of a disc to be used during vinyl manufacture. There were two options to consider. A Direct Metal Master (DMM), developed in the late seventies, allows sound to be cut directly into a stainless steel disc coated with a hard copper alloy. The older, alternative method is to cut the sound into the soft lacquer coating on a nickel disc - the first of several steps leading to the production of a stamper to press the vinyl', ""A 'blind' listening test was arranged to choose between a 'lacquer' or 'copper' cut. Using both methods, A Hard Day's Night was pressed with ten seconds of silence at the beginning and end of each side. This allowed not only the reproduction of the music to be assessed, but also the noise made by the vinyl itself. After much discussion, two factors swung the decision towards using the lacquer process. First, it was judged to create a warmer sound than a DMM. Secondly, there was a practical advantage of having 'blank' discs of a consistent quality when cutting lacquers"", ""The next step was to use the Neumann VMS80 cutting lathe at Abbey Road. Following thorough mechanical and electrical tests to ensure it was operating in peak condition, engineer Sean Magee cut the LPs in chronological release order. He used the original 24-bit remasters rather than the 16-bit versions that were required for CD production. It was also decided to use the remasters that had not undergone 'limiting' - a procedure to increase the sound level, which is deemed necessary for most current pop CDs"", ""Having made initial test cuts, Magee pinpointed any sound problems that can occur during playback of vinyl records. To rectify them, changes were made to the remasters with a Digital Audio Workstation. For example, each vinyl album was listened to for any 'sibilant episodes' - vocal distortion that can occur on consonant sounds such as S and T. These were corrected by reducing the level in the very small portion of sound causing the undesired effect. Similarly, any likelihood of 'inner-groove distortion' was addressed. As the stylus approaches the centre of the record, it is liable to track the groove less accurately. This can affect the high-middle frequencies, producing a 'mushy' sound particularly noticeable on vocals. Using what Magee has described as 'surgical EQ,' problem frequencies were identified and reduced in level to compensate for this"", 'The last phase of the vinyl mastering process began with the arrival of the first batches of test pressings made from master lacquers that had been sent to the two pressing plant factories. Stringent quality tests identified any noise or click appearing on more than one test pressing in the same place. If this happened, it was clear that the undesired sounds had been introduced either during the cutting or the pressing stage and so the test records were rejected. In the quest to achieve the highest quality possible, the Abbey Road team worked closely with the pressing factories and the manufacturers of the lacquer and cutting styli', ""An additional and unusual challenge was to ensure the proper playback of the sounds embedded in the 'lock-groove' at the end of side two of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Requiring a combination of good timing and luck, it had always been a lengthy and costly process to make it work properly. In fact, it was so tricky, it had never been attempted for American pressings of the LP. Naturally, Sean Magee and the team perfected this and the garbled message is heard as originally intended on the remastered Sgt. Pepper LP.""]",,"[{'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sTwXNCJSL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sTwXNCJSL.jpg', 'variant': 'MAIN', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LhyQ8iNmL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sjzZp3enL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sjzZp3enL.jpg', 'variant': 'BACK', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91YWEWrSxML._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510OFe1TH4L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510OFe1TH4L.jpg', 'variant': 'PT02', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Ihs81KzML._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EEvPZjJrL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EEvPZjJrL.jpg', 'variant': 'PT03', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JTrxvK4vL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KoORlDv6L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KoORlDv6L.jpg', 'variant': 'PT04', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Wp9K5fwIL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g0SxWMA9L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g0SxWMA9L.jpg', 'variant': 'PT05', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91AeDDoP4uL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tq9KykraL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tq9KykraL.jpg', 'variant': 'PT06', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91CCySUL0kL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIbx5ZA0L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIbx5ZA0L.jpg', 'variant': 'PT07', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91kcITF7X2L._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-owKsGOWL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-owKsGOWL.jpg', 'variant': 'PT08', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91LaPHGaK4L._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518Oqer6H2L._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518Oqer6H2L.jpg', 'variant': 'PT09', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91tVzcUVqTL._SL1500_.jpg'}, {'thumb': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nGMPgCzBL._SS40_.jpg', 'large': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nGMPgCzBL.jpg', 'variant': 'PT10', 'hi_res': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91lN-dVtBNL._SL1500_.jpg'}]","[{'title': 'The Beatles: Vinyl Product Walkthrough', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/2df464237c05400486521a63ab2fdc40?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0', 'user_id': ''}, {'title': 'This is a real deal', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/5bfae5c00d3a472f9a6484c477c6b67c?ref=dp_vse_rvc_1', 'user_id': 'AHH6ORX64JNHQDWEQC6B2Z2KT4XQ'}]",The Beatles   Format: Vinyl,"['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classic Rock', 'Psychedelic Rock']","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '12.52 x 12.48 x 0.28 inches; 15.45 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'EMI', 'Item model number': '5099969942617', 'Date First Available': 'June 25, 2012', 'Label': 'EMI', 'Number of discs': '1'}",B0041KVXLK,,,
