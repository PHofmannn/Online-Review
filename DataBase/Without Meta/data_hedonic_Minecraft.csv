5.0,Great game,My husband got this when we got a Nintendo Switch for christmas.  None of us had any idea what it was.  We stumbled our way through trying to figure it out. Then we discovered on youtube 'POG Productionz' and that revolutionized our excitement toward this game.  My six year old son watches 'POG' daily - he makes the most amazing things in Minecraft and it is so inspirational.  Still a fav game in our house six months later and will continue I imagine. We generally just play on peaceful and creative.  I recommend you check out POG if you are new to this too - He does whole series and makes incredible cities - it really teaches you a lot what you can do on Minecraft.

Even when it's working correctly, the load times are pretty long. Then there will be bugs where destroyed blocks don't disappear.<br /><br />It's playable if you can get a really good deal on it, but as this is the most expensive version of the Bedrock game, I would strongly recommend getting it on a different platform.

I have not played Minecraft on any other platforms than the Switch. It's not a secret that the Switch is certainly lacking in processing power and graphics capability compared to other modern consoles or PC's, but it is very limiting to Minecraft.<br /><br />My issues with at least the Switch version is how bad it bogs down. Once you get a decent amount built on a world, it becomes so laggy it's unplayable. Actions don't do anything, nothing spawns, the game locks up, you can't get in your inventory, etc. I can't fathom how a 40 MB file can do this on a modern system, but it sure does. A Google search shows this is a pretty common issue on Switch, and there was nothing to do about it but basically delete all the saved data and start over, and the developers haven't done anything to patch it to where it will consistently run on Switch.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AFXGSPUGWEKJENYDNCYEHUOLMPUQ,2022-07-21 01:51:53.495,0,True

5.0,Cross Play works great!,I'm impressed with this version running on the Switch in both TV and Portable mode. I never owned it on the Wii U and I always did for the Mario packs but decided to wait as I have Minecraft everywhere else for my nephew. We play Cross Play from Switch to Xbox One and it's great. The Mario theme stuff does not work cross play which is understandable. It's really cool as well that I can play with him online with packs he bought on his xbox. I also enjoy that you can use the joy cons separately though I prefer using my Pro Controller and bought him a separate Hori controller (that works extremely well) for local play. Even after all these years it's still pretty fun to go around the world of Minecraft.<br />Highly recommended!,[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AGUECOURI3BG2E4FNJ6CHDY7SVKA,2018-08-03 02:51:36.176,53,True
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I looked forward to getting the switch version of Minecraft to be able to play while mobile in a better format than with a phone or tablet. Big mistake. This game crashes almost everytime I try to play, usually before the game is even loaded.<br /><br />I didn't expect a completely standalone console experience with Nintendo's underpowered semi-handheld, but usually the crashes happen before loading an actual world. Sometimes in the middle of exploring or mining, so good luck getting back your progress!<br /><br />The autosave system will sometimes deign to do it's job, but only when the game feels like it's warranted. The draw distance is pitiful, and the framerate drops even in survival.

2.0,A fun building game... but only single-player works properly!,"I first tried this game on iPad. I was evaluating it to see if it would be good for my daughter to play. But I found it engaging myself and spent many hours playing around. It's a simple game where you gather resources and build things in a pixelated art-style 3D world. It's kind of like playing in a sandbox. There is no story, but kids love the creative freedom to explore, fend off monsters, and build all sorts of things.<br /><br />I am reviewing the Nintendo Switch version here. I would rate it higher, but the online capability on the Switch is abysmal. Years ago, we tried networking a few devices to play over local connection (two iOS devices and a Switch). Even with that simple setup, we suffered frequent connection disruptions. By now, you would think that Microsoft would have improved things. The game now claims to offer online multiplayer on the Switch. But I found it to be utterly broken and non-functional. I have a solid internet setup at my house. But the game always fails to connect me with my Switch friends online. Signing in with a Microsoft account seemed to work better at first. But then it inexplicably started causing the game to lock up whenever I logged on with the Microsoft account.<br /><br />It's a completely broken and frustrating experience trying to use the online features. If you stick to the single-player game, it's enjoyable as a simple little sandbox game. If Microsoft can't get the online experience right, they shouldn't claim that the game is playable online. They should wait until they have it working properly before releasing those features.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AEOWNGYJ3AU6L5IHG2KY5YVTLUJQ,2022-10-09 17:24:59.350,0,False

4.0,"Some strange changes but overall, its Minecraft","As others have stated before, to play with your friends away from each other online, you're gonna have to deal with Nintendos proprietary online surface which is lame. It is what it is.<br /><br />When it comes to other things, for example the offhand slot in game, it is EXTREMELY limited in comparison to the PC version where you can offhand virtually any item in the game. With this version, you can only effectively use in the offhand maps, and shields. Shields in particular you use by ""sneaking""/crouching.<br /><br />Besides those things, it is by all means Minecraft, and relatively up to date to boot as this is the ""Bedrock Edition"".<br /><br />One of the more impressive features is the ability to play fully locally with up to four players simultaneously EVEN IN TABLETOP mode!<br />There is a local wireless play as well. So if your friends have their Switch's with them, you can play with them even without the Nintendo online service. So if possible, to play effectively with others, try playing locally on one Switch, or attempt to play via local wireless with multiple Switch systems.<br /><br />Yes Command Blocks are in this. So you can make those ""in game mods"" that are implemented solely by Command Blocks. That alone is a very powerful feature to be present.<br /><br />As for any additional tips for this particular version I can give is, try going into the settings, go to the control rebind section(s), and bind ""Jump"" to ""clicking"" the Left stick. Then bind ""Sneak"" to the Right stick click. Those two bindings in combination helps a lot I've found.<br />Do note that as of 1/29/2020, there doesn't seem to be any way to disable ""double tap forward to dash"". So if you want to sprint, tap forward twice and you'll sprint. It would've been nice if it had a checkbox to disable that in case you wanted to bind sprinting to something else and not accidentally sprint from double tapping forward.<br /><br />All in all, if you goal isn't the online multiplayer, or you used the offhand feature and love it to death on PC, you're better off staying on PC/Windows-10-Version. If you can live with those compromises, or your party of friends like to play locally to begin with, its a great time! Its definitely a lot more manageable to make those large buildings by chipping away at your tasks a little bit at a time. Which is really easy to do due to the nature of the Switch.<br /><br />Do note that in order to play with others locally on one Switch system, you'll need to give your friends some sort of controller that has two joy sticks. You could hypothetically use a gamecube adapter in docked mode, and let your friends play with you via Gamecube controller. So no, you cannot play with one Joy Con per player in this game. But considering it uses twin stick controls, that is to be expected.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AFHK67RLQRZS7XS6NAQG6ALYCQPA,2020-01-30 07:42:42.679,2,True

1.0,An extremely buggy and poorly optimized port to the Nintendo Switch.,"An extremely poor port. This new version is buggy, lags, and has poor frame rate and huge rendering drops, compared to the traditional console edition. Inventory gets deleted, game crashes, multiplayer chugs. It's a very, very poor port. My advice is to buy the Nintendo Switch Edition of Minecraft on the Eshop, and wait for this port to be fixed (if it ever does [Xbox players have been complaining about this port since it launched back in 2017]). You can buy the eShop version and get a free upgrade to the new ""Minecraft"" edition, that this is. Your old worlds can even be converted over. Though, like I said, this port is extremely buggy and difficult to deal with.

I spent nearly 500 hours on the Switch Edition before the Bedrock edition finally released for the Switch.<br /><br />I was hesitant to purchase the Bedrock edition as I had played it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5"" and it was quite glitchy and the graphics were different enough to catch my attention.  I am glad that I purchased it because the issues I have on my Galaxy Tab S were, apparently, due to the limitations of the tablet's hardware.  The Bedrock edition for my Switch has been running smoothly, although the map generation is different than the Switch edition which is a bit of a bummer.<br /><br />Overall, I quite enjoy the Bedrock edition and having the ability to play with friends on Xbox One, Windows 10, Android, and Apple systems is a great bonus.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AF2TTSN3XGH73RLACJOYYK2X4ZTQ,2018-10-23 21:43:41.411,5,True

4.0,"I'm happy I picked it up, but I hope these glitches get fixed","The framerate seems pretty solid to me. The Mario theme is a bit gimmicky and doesn't appeal to me, and the music gets old. The simulation distance is capped at 8 chunks which would have been nice to be able to increase. Battery life seems good, 3 hours took me to about 55% from a full charge. Local multiplayer was not laggy at all. Overall a great portable version of minecraft, but after about 30 hours of gameplay, I've seen a few glitches (even after a software update) that I hope will be fixed:<br /><br />1. The menu cursor gets in a loop where it'll keep moving in a certain direction. This is not a problem with my controller since it doesn't affect me outside of the menu, or on the Switch home screen.

Itll slow you down.<br /><br />But, the bag it came in wasn't even really damaged at all, and I pull the game out looking like this.<br /><br />It has a big hole in the side of the case.. which is pretty damn ugly if you like to collect games and keep them neat in their cases.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed in the way the product arrived. 1 star for the damaged case.<br /><br />Add the 5 stars and the 1 star, then divide it by 2, and the median is a 3 star rating.<br /><br />Thanks.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RaojG-qNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RaojG-qNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RaojG-qNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WEuQychEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WEuQychEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WEuQychEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ti2zwiioL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ti2zwiioL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ti2zwiioL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AHAPIXWFKTJDDDTVKCEZWZFR3D7A,2021-05-06 20:02:36.093,1,True

1.0,"Great game, no support for Switch and game-breaking bugs","This is a great game.  My daughter loves playing it.  Everyone and their brother knows it's a great game.<br /><br />I am writing this review to warn parents that the company that makes the game, Mojang, cannot seem to be bothered to care about the switch version.  Until they fix the Switch version all reviews should be 1 star.<br /><br />There are game-breaking problems that you would expect to only see in the worst games you can find on the market.  It is beyond me why this company can't fix these problems because they are very basic.  Do they have trained wombats doing their coding?  The problems also seem to change over time, but are equally bad.<br /><br />For a long time, the switch version had terrible scene loading and glitch problems.  These seemed to finally be repaired by some update.<br /><br />Now the switch version, for some reason, takes 5-10 minutes to load your Microsoft Account info, which you need to play online.  If you attempt to load a game before this info loads, it just doesn't place the character creation content into the game (which many refer to as ""skins"").  This is the hair, clothing, styles for your character.  More often than not the ""skin"" info never loads regardless of time waited.<br /><br />Now if I were to play Minecraft, I'd be patient and wait for the stuff to load, and whatever I don't care what my character looks like I'll just mine or build.  To my child, and many children, part of the fun is making their character look cool.  My child changes the way the character looks like once every 15 minutes.  My child is old enough to start the game themselves, but not really patient enough to wait for the ""maybe it will load eventually, maybe it won't"" character skins.  This causes massive frustration for children.  My child essentially doesn't want to play the game because they can't change their character most of the time.  So that was $$ I just threw in the trash.<br /><br />*If* you have a child, you will also understand how frustrating it is when their friend who is playing online with them can change their character and they can't.  Since the ""skin"" loading is completely random as to whether it will work, and rarely works, you are also spending time trying ""help"" and to reload the game 10 times to see if it will load this time.  Now you just wasted an hour and half.<br /><br />All of this is ridiculous.  Character creation is really basic, you just load content.  NO, and I mean NO other game I play on the Switch or anywhere else has this basic, newb, fundamental problem.  Why is this basic function not fixable by Mojang?  Trained wombats.<br /><br />Avoid all this headache and buy the game on some other platform.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AEGKSOU3PKYYAXH6C4NAIONHVH3A,2022-08-22 12:15:13.523,0,False

1.0,Nintendo Switch Online Doesn't Work,"I purchased 2 copies of this version of Minecraft to play with my son who lives in another state. After having trouble figuring out how Minecraft was going to work under the Nintendo Online system I went ahead and bought two versions and started fiddling with it. That's when I noticed how poor the system works with 2 big problems.<br /><br />1. The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.<br /><br />2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues. I found myself disconnected on a few occasions, or situations where I could no longer see my son's avatar even though he was right in front of me (I witnessed this over facetime). Other issues like landscape (FOV) not appearing seem pretty common in multiplayer.<br /><br />The singleplayer is fine and the controls once you get used to them work great, but the primary reason I got 2 copies of this was so I could play online and that feature is doesn't work. If the problem can be resolved I'll change my review.<br /><br />Update: 6+ months later and the Nintendo Online feature still does the same thing and I've had to continue paying for a microsoft realm for us to both play on.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AG5EJLTRQRB6DM5YBH2YW3JFRS5A,2018-11-09 03:01:42.710,249,True

1.0,Too many Crashes!,"I bought this game card for my Nintendo in February of this year, and ever since then I have been experiencing a plethora of issues and crashes. First off, there will be times where I will leave the game and when I come back my profile won‚Äôt pop up leaving me to either wait and see what happens(which usually leaves me waiting like 5 minutes) or go through Microsoft and log in again(which can be so annoying). Another issue I have is with online playing otherwise known as Realms. There are so many bugs I don‚Äôt even know where to start, so I‚Äôll just give you the cliff notes. There are times where the blocks won‚Äôt break or blocks that I didn‚Äôt click on will disappear, times where I will randomly lose health for no reason, and when I have to log back on the game(due to a situation I will get to later) some of my items will disappear, along with many many more. My biggest issue with this game card out of everything is that I will be playing on realms and all of the sudden the game will glitch out and tell me that my server is disconnected. I have to log back out of the game and come back in(sometimes having to restart the entire console) which can be literal torture due to the previous issues I have mentioned before. I have absolutely no explanation as to why this game card has so many positive reviews other than the brand selling this paying them off because there is no way they are genuinely enjoying this glitchy mess. I write this dissertation to say that you should not let the positive reviews fool you, don‚Äôt be an idiot like me who is now stuck with this mess; turn far, far away and find another seller that can give you what you have paid for because clearly Microsoft can‚Äôt.",[],B07D13QGXM,B07D13QGXM,AHXSF4VA63UD456HGZLROOMLFC4A,2021-06-15 03:17:05.395,1,True
