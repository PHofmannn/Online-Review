5.0,So much fun!!,"I remember being in 5th grade when Mario 64 came out, it was as amazing! I grabbed this for my 3 kids to try, they are loving it. They beat Odyssey pretty quickly, they are actually struggling with 64! I never played Sunshine or Galaxy, but they are pretty good too. Really happy with my purchase!

4.0,Newbie Review,"I have never played any of the 3D Mario Games and I have been gaming since the Atari 2600. I've played the original, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3 , Lost Levels etc sparingly. I can tell you the camera on Mario 64 is pretty bad. I'm getting used to it, but it's definitely showing its age. I haven't gotten into the other titles as of this review, but I hope they improve. Three games for $59.99 isn't terrible, but these aren't even ground up HD remasters; they're emulations. Don't get me wrong, they look great, and there is an improvement, but for Mario's 35th Nintendo could have done a little better.

5.0,Fantastic Collection of Classic 3D Super Mario Games,"Whether you grew up playing these games or not, they are certainly presented here in their very best formats (with the exception of running Dolphin), that to say some of the obtuse controls and camera angles cannot prevent the first two from showing their age some. Despite this their importance in the 3D platforming genre remains and they are still as much fun to play now as they were then.<br /><br />Yeah extras would have been nice, but knowing Nintendo and their tendencies to keep these kind of releases pretty dry I wasn't very surprised. The album availabilities are a nice addition, and if you purchased the digital set you're eligible for the ""My Nintendo"" Super Mario 35th Anniversary enamel pin set (sure to be a collector item).<br /><br />If you've enjoyed Super Mario Odyssey, just know that Super Mario 64 served as the blueprints for that open world adventure, necessary polygon building blocks to set up future Mario greatness.

5.0,Nostalgic,"I have been having SO much fun with this! On the title screen, you can select what game you want to play OR listen to the soundtrack for any of the three games. Once you select your game, it transports you to the “main menu” of the game you selected. So far, the modifications to the Switch have been great and just take a little adjusting. Mario 64 is still a little janky with the controls and I wish you could edit/modify them, but you cannot. However, the controls were always a little odd so it’s not a surprise. Still able to navigate it and complete the levels. I’ve been having a LOT of fun and am shocked with how much I remember about these games from my childhood!

3.0,Great compilation of classic games with faults,"My review is not for the games themselves all three are great and they play well here. There’s really no need to talk about them. My review is more so the way Nintendo handled this release with a “limited” window. Also the PAL cart looks much better than the ntsc. Go and search it you’ll see what I mean. My biggest gripe with this is there is no ability to change controls or any sort of additional features to the games which would be standard for any sort of compilation like this. In particular sunshine, I’m an invert Y player yet there is no ability to do this. Makes the game such a pain. Which I’m sure could be fixed in an update to add those features but we know it won’t happen.<br /><br />I love these three games but truthfully for what was presented a 60 dollar package this is not.

4.0,Lotsa fun,"Lazy Nintendo emulator cash grab, and pointless limited release aside, I’m having a lot of fun with this collection. Honestly I’d pay the money just for Galaxy, which is my favorite Mario so far. I have fond memories of being in absolute awe when I first played it on the wii back in the day. It works well with the detached joycons to use the motion controls the way it was meant to be played.<br /><br />Mario 64 is here too, and that takes me back to the good ole days. I never did beat Mario 64 that I can recall, so looking forward to finally getting around to that.<br /><br />Mario sunshine I never played more than the intro on the GameCube. Of the 3, this is the one that excites me the least, but after I beat the other 2 I’ll def give it a go. I’ve played a bit and I noticed they ditched the ridiculous inverted controls, which is good for me. I’m sure some people are going to be upset that there is no apparent way to switch it back.<br /><br />My major gripe, if I have to have one, is the collectible pin set that was supposed to be available to everyone that bought the game. Even though they made clear that this was a “while supplies last” kind of thing, I expected supplies to last for more than an hour. On the first day they were made available, they were no longer available, which means they may have had a few hundred or a thousand sets of these, if that. They probably paid enough for a minimum quantity production run from the factory and called it a day, not caring how many people they would disappoint. Yes I’m a 32 year old man and I’m pissed about a retarded Chinese-made pin set, lol. Seriously, gone within and hour?

There are no additional levels or characters like in the DS Mario 64 remake, no new unlockable levels, no concept art, interviews, or anything like that aside from the ability to listen to the songs from the games on the main menu.

5.0,Great deal for price,People are entitled to an opinion about Nintendo releasing these games in a set of three for $60 but most are legitimately crying over the price because they aren’t remastered.

4.0,Just an software emulated ROM without any new fixes,"Bought it mainly to relive my early teenage Super Mario 64 years on a modern 1080P TV. The picture is nice and sharp.

Look it up on youtube. It would've only taken a few mins to change one line on the source code. Also all three games are software emulated instead of having a proper port (guess Nintendo just wanted to milk our nostalgia for $60 without actually working for it).

4.0,3 great games with some caviats,"this collection contains 3 games from Mario's past that were amazing, super Mario 64 was a revolutionary game for its time bringing in amazing 3d graphics for the time which was 1996 and ultimately brought gaming into the 3d era. super Mario sunshine is a weird but ultimately cult classic that has aged tremendously well, Mario galaxy is an incredible classic that brings Mario's adventures to space. the problem occurs when you realize that they did not remaster the graphics at all and took an approach similar to old movie releases like the terminator or lion king animated and especially the Pixar movies (I wish they would remaster toy story 1-3 with toy story 4 visuals), and for a video game it is a weird approach. and with the limited-time release, you could say Nintendo is taking the Disney vault approach when it comes to there classic games with no word if they are going to rerelease these games on a virtual console containing N64 - GameCube - Wii mainly because the WII u port well is running dry. and sadly galaxy 2 is not included in this and just like Disney censored the racism in the original fantasia. I do think if this collection was released on a later console that Mario Odyssey would be part of the collection. ultimately though if you want to relive your childhood or if you want to experience 1 or 2 or all 3 for the first time then I do think this would be a good buy, and I do think that I would give this 3.5 stars out of 5 but because amazon won't let me do that because the games are actually good I am giving this collection a 4 out of 5 stars","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610tY93wCsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610tY93wCsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610tY93wCsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHLDG5UCLZJDOMFSTNKREZ4BFZCA,2020-09-28 19:39:01.818,1,True

Too many buttons are re-used for different functions and it's impossible to play.<br /><br />Sunshine -- you can't invert the y axis. This is 100% a deal breaker.

4.0,Yeah!,"I bought a switch for this game. My family is obsessed with Mario Kart. We upgraded from a Wii.<br /><br />Good:<br />Graphics are nice/cute. Game is MUCH easier than the Wii version. They have some features which keep you turned the right direction and when the race starts you get an initial boost. Our daughter who struggled to finish races is now in 6th place.<br /><br />I like that they revamped some old tracks. I like that they are releasing new tracks. I did my homework so I knew half the new tracks aren’t unlocked yet.<br /><br />Online play is fun, but slightly soul crushing.<br /><br />Love the vehicle customization options.<br /><br />Love that you can pick how many races you want to do.<br /><br />Bad:<br />Game is glitchy.<br /><br />Sometimes steering is a little off.<br /><br />Often enemies will appear right in front of you where before they didn’t exist (yes worse than the Wii.)<br /><br />Races seem a lot shorter.<br /><br />Tracks change the second and third time through. Meh.<br /><br />Not enough characters.<br /><br />Overall wish they had spent some more time on it. I feel like this has become one of Nintendo’s core games so it should have been a knock out and not feel glitchy. Plus like… it’s a super expensive game with online access required to unlock levels so I feel like it should be near perfect.<br /><br />Overall recommend this game to anyone that has kids or likes Mario Kart.

1.0,This is the most lazy first-party port I've ever seen,"Nintendo made this a MASSIVE deal. I was very excited to play it, until I realized that it is just like the classics...….. Except much, much worse. When a third party emulator plays these games 10 times better than the switch does, it really tells you how much effort Nintendo put into this ""port"".<br /><br />Super Mario 64<br /> - The game plays in a little square in the middle of the screen. Why did they not make this widescreen? It runs at 30fps, but somehow there are frame drops when there are more than 5 enemies on the screen. How are there frame drops in a 24 year old game? The controls are also unmappable, and they inverted them from the original.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine<br /> - Very buggy, controls inverted from the original, on screen it tells you to hit the wrong buttons (they didn't change the original text to tell you to hit the buttons that are compatible with the Nintendo switch)…. Oh..... and since the switches controllers have analog triggers, you can't control water pressure. This never should have made its way to the switch in its current rushed state.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy<br /> - The joy cons are not as accurate for pointing as the Wii mote. This makes it extremely hard to collect stars, and you have to hit the recalibrate button every 10-15 seconds. Also, there is no alternative to motion controls or touchscreen controls so you will always be uncomfortable playing this.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake I made and jump the gun on this one. For $60, in the games current state it doesn't make sense.

Nintendo played us on this one....,"Sorely disappointed in this... usually Nintendo is pretty good about their titles... and particularly the ones that are reissued.   This one,  however, is a pretty obvious cash grab with very little effort put into it.   It started by creating a frenzy by stating its a ""limited run in physical copies""... something not entirely new to those familiar with switch titles.  That served as a fine distraction from what is really going on.... the fact that Nintendo didn't put any effort into this.   First... the major complaints I had with Mario64 in its original release were the controls and the camera system.  I thought perhaps I could look past that for upgrade graphics... but honestly we don't even get that. We get what they say is increased resolution... but honestly doesn't look much better.  And they slapped us square in the face (square...pun intended)  with the fact that it's STILL 4:3 aspect ratio. A friend said ""that's really difficult to convert to HD 16:9"".  Okay... for you and me.. sure... but this is Nintendo.... the often-proven kings of that game... and for sixty bucks.... do SOMETHING with it.... please?  Add to that the fact that it's a straight port.... the camera controls are (still) garbage.... and the controls themselves are (still)  in the can with the camera.... and what you've got is a slightly improved resolution on a nearly 25 year old game.  My advice? If you're playing 64 on this platform,  set your TV to ""stretch"".  With the upped resolution...its ""almost"" bearable. <br /><br /> Mario Galaxy was the one title of the three of never played.  It looks pretty decent,  graphics wise,  but be forewarned...if you're a pro controller die-hard like me... you're in for a rude awakening.  Multiple news sources stated that WOULD be an option to play without motion controls..And it ALMOST is true. Motion controls are not required...in handheld mode.   In TV mode... no option.... even with a pro controller you have to use motion controls... and that's just clunky as hell... The better option is to play with joy-cons.... but i absolutely, morbidly despise Joy Cons. They are the bane of my existence.   And I don't play in handheld mode.  So, if you're like me... docked and a pro- controller user...There's no way to play without motion controls.  Not acceptable to me... especially given the horribly misleading news prior to release stating the contrary.  If someone figures out that I'm wrong... and can tell me how to do that... I'll listen. But it's not obvious if it's, indeed,  available as an option.<br /><br />The standout here is Sunshine.   It's flawless.  It's pro-controller compatible,  looks great in upped resolution,  and plays great as well.   So,  basically I paid 60  dollars for a straight port of Sunshine... and soundtracks I could find on YouTube.  If you're good with a misleading release campaign,  an underwhelming effort by Nintendo to make any of these much better than the originals... and soundtracks... jump on and have fun.  <br /><br />Me?  I stand firmly in the ""shame on you Nintendo"" crowd.  ","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VU7Qndc7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VU7Qndc7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VU7Qndc7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AF5SEKBT4ZMSUZCRXLMYCVJJMOHQ,2020-09-19 00:50:59.570,36,True

For those who will inevitably ask about it, ZR is the default soft pressure nozzle which can be used while running, and R is the hard pressure nozzle for stand-still aiming. Sunshine also packs a significant challenge and demands your precision. Mario Galaxy already looked amazing and looks even better, its a full 1080p with 60 FPS (Mario Sunshine is 30 FPS like the original is).

3.0,Great Games Poor Customization.,"The games included are great in their own right, but lack customization and features expected in a quality re-released emulated title. The games play great and are smooth, but the package is kind of underwhelming in its presentation. The controls for galaxy don't feel as natural or satisfying as the Wii, but they get the job done and is a small price to pay to experience the game in its native texture resolutions for the first time. The absence of Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a stab in the gut. It's clear Nintendo plans on milking us further for yet another old title to be polished slightly then priced as a new original $60 title. That combined with the fact that the digital edition will also be fazed out with the hard copies scream anti-consumer as they will most likely be using this false scarcity to boost short-time sales while still being able to charge full price for these games years later when they decide to reintroduce them. If you love these titles, buy the game. If you could care less and want to combat this anticonsumer strategy I'd pass on this one as there is nothing fundamentally new added to the experience that you can't achieve through emulation of your other owned copies.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AH5VY6P5674XUUKKYWEMZGSBW4QQ,2020-09-26 18:01:12.846,0,True

Mario sunshine very quickly I noticed that they didn’t fix the camera bug. Kinda disappointing but still the game looks great and controls pretty good. Mario 64 is pretty underwhelming but to able to play the original game in portable is cool. At least it’s better than the DS port. Overall I think it’s worth the price if you like these games.

3.0,Too much luck. Little focus on skill.,"So many flaws. You could do literally everything perfect sometimes and still lose because of getting hit with a blue shell at the last second. It's especially annoying when you should have had a much larger lead. If you watch the A.I you can see they're not very skilled but somehow they're always right behind you. When they're in front of you it's impossible to predict what box they're gonna get because they move side to side in random directions. In 200cc it you need to press the brake but the A.I doesnt need to. I read that in the first mario kart it was extra hard because instead of making intelligent A.I racers they just gave them unfair advantages. They are still just as lazy well over 20 years later. I don't mind losing if it's fair but its extremely frustrating when you did nothing wrong. Also the vehicle strengths and weaknesses are inaccurate. I choose a vehicle that was better than the one I use and it had less control even though it said it has better traction and control. Another bs addition is making you pay to play online. This was free on wii. All the unlockable stuff is worthless. You would think everytime you unlock a vehicle it would be better than the last one but it's not. If you beat every level you get gold mario but he's not better than the other characters. I would say the worst thing about the game is getting hit with 4 things in a row and going from first place to last place. This goes back to a point I made earlier. Not only should u not be able to get hit that many times in a row but most times it makes no sense that everybody is right behind you even though u've driven perfect. As I said earlier losing isn't that frustrating but losing when it makes no sense is extremely frustrating. Especially when to get 3 gold stars u have to finish 1st in 4 races in a row. Out of these 4 races some bs is bound to happen on one of the tracks which ruins your 3 gold stars. And yet another flaw, after that bs happens, you can't just retry the race. You have to start all 4 races from the beginning. And with 200cc it's not fun. You have to constantly press the brake(some tracks are more annoying than others) and ot doesn't make sense in terms of physics. Whether you're going super fast or just starting off you have the same crappy control. Sometimes you get stuck against the wall even when pressing the brake. Another thing that is absurd is the boost you get when driving behind people. If everybody is driving close together you'll get a boost you dont want that sometimes sends you flying off the edge in levels like rainbow road. Again this is especially frustrating because it's sometimes unavoidable and not your fault. Also on levels like rainbow road I end up in first place only getting mushroom boosts that you cant even use because of the lack of straight track. I'm sure there's more flaws I haven't thought of but I'll leave it at that for now.<br /><br />Since I included so many flaws ill also list some positives....<br />-solid graphics for a mario kart game<br />-i like that there's  2 ways to stop the blue shell<br />-until you reach 200cc, drifting is pretty fun when you master it<br />-decent amount of levels, even though they use old levels to make it seem like there's more levels than there really is(this goes back to them being lazy like with cheating A.I drivers). I like playing older levels but there should be more new ones.<br />-good amount of characters to choose from<br />-rain looks pretty cool<br />Just like the flaws there is probably some positives I'm forgetting",[],B01N1081RO,B08JHZHWZ3,AGKGNGOXWI7Q4IVTG4STZA67VAZA,2021-09-23 10:58:50.474,34,True

4.0,My Nostalgic Story and Review,"I am 26 years old. (27 after two days I posted this review) Most of you who have this game understand completely why these three Mario games were some of best during your childhood. I'm one of those people. Now I understand people can play these already from some emulated port for PC, but it feels wonderful to finally see more throwback 3d games from previous Nintendo consoles on to the Switch.<br /><br />I was screaming when Sunshine showed up in the collection. As a kid in the early 2000s, It was actually my 2rd most frequently played video game during the GameCube Era. Mario64 was okay, I haven't really played that much on the 64 due to the cartridge kept getting dirty and causing it to freeze too often. Of course I had no idea how to properly clean it back then. As for the Mario Galaxy, I never owned the Wii but my niece sure did. When she first got it on Christmas and showed me the game-play, I was completely invested. I even took over her Wii just for that purpose. What a horrible Uncle I am, but she didn't mind.<br /><br />Real talk about the three games. All of them resembles as an album of respected Mario titles that were well praised in their respective console eras. It also tells the next generation of gamers how our gen feels about these 3 particular titles. Now would love to give an all out 5 Star review to this but I wish they added a little more features in the main collection menu. The complete soundtrack is nice and all, but I was hoping they would add some rough/finished concept artwork, sketches and maybe even some fan-art back in those eras. I would like to see some personal interviews with the Lead Developers and Designers of the 3 games. Koji Kondo would really surprise me.<br /><br />Overall, I love it and there's no way I'm ever going give or sell this game to anyone for as long as I live.<br /><br />Thank You Nintendo! :)",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHTRDNJKG2VPXCJMHKMSQY445QHA,2020-09-27 02:18:40.038,0,True

(Docked)<br /><br />- Super Mario Galaxy runs at 1080p 60 FPS, up from 720p 30 FPS. (Docked)<br /><br />- This is the updated version of Super Mario 64, that fixes the backwards long jump glitch and removes some voice lines from Mario I.E. ""So long, King Bowser!""<br /><br />- You are not able to change the camera options in Super Mario Sunshine, you can however change the controller settings outside of the game if this is a big enough issue for you. However there is nothing you can do for the lack of analog triggers. I didn't see this as much of an issue personally.<br /><br />- These are NOT remakes. A few textures are updated here and there, and the UI is updated where is needed, but overall this will be the exact same experience you played through the first time, at upgraded resolutions.<br /><br />- You can turn your screen off while listening to the soundtrack, which is a great feature for listening in bed or on the go.<br /><br />Overall this is a great package, so long as you know what you are getting. Temper your expectations if you were expecting a full remaster, because that's not what you'll find.

3.0,Enjoyable but frustrating,"As somebody who only grew up with Mario Galaxy 2, and played the old ones on emulator. I was excited to see that Nintendo was giving fans a chance to relive the glory days of 3D Mario on their newest and dare I say most popular console, the Nintendo Switch ( not to say the new games are bad, the old ones just have a certain magic to them ). I honestly don't know what I expected. The controls are a bit weird to get used to, ( especially in Mario 64 and Sunshine ) but to me that's excusable considering 64 and Sunshine are quite ""ancient"", if you want to describe it that way. One gripe I do have is the camera, something just feels wrong about it even though these are supposed to be direct ports, maybe I'm not used to the actual camera since emulators can slightly change things, so I'll leave that to your own discernment if you buy this game. Now, I do have two issues with this game. One major issue I personally have is that Nintendo went out of their way to remove some of the most iconic glitches in these games, most notably the back wards long jump, which allows for some fun glitches and antics inside of the game. As someone who enjoys speed runs, I can't exactly see why Nintendo did this, as a casual player would probably be too lazy/too ignorant to abuse these glitches, while the old fans and speedrunners would appreciate Nintendo not patching these glitches out. Heck, it might have even reignited a passion and popularity for speed running these games as old speedrunners could move to upgraded hardware and new speedrunners could simply buy this game and start their career of speedrunning 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy, boosting sales of not only Nintendo switches and this game, and possibly eliminate the need to support Nintendo's greatest enemy, emulation. For me it was a missed opportunity to kind of redeem Nintendo's social status and have them reconnect with their player base since they haven't been the exactly been greatest and consumer friendly company the last 2 years. The second gripe I have is a minor one, and that is Nintendo's motion support for the pro controller in galaxy. Thankfully, Nintendo was smart enough to keep the cursor reset button but still it's a pain to use the pro controller, and I don't think anybody wants to use the barely functional joy-cons. Regardless of my complaints, I still think this is a great title worthy of buying to gift for somebody who has recently become a fan of the Mario series/long time fan/new switch owner.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AF5GQS2735GFILP3HZHHS7RFGPEQ,2021-12-30 03:59:27.961,0,True

Going to where the Hazy Maze Cave areas are and where you go to drain the castle moat.  The whole atmosphere is a part of why I love it so much.  I love castles and I love how there's this black hole where the balls roll into in Hazy Maze Cave,  the horizontal elevator and the music where you find Dorrie is really awesome.

So many, many things that make this the best, too many to list!!<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine and Galaxy are awesome too, even though some parts of Sunshine feels more like work.

Super Mario 64 is amazing as well, I remember playing with the girl next door on her 64 as a kid. It was the first modern Mario game and even though it came out in 96' its an amazing game even today.

5.0,Wonderful Memories in SD Brought Back to Life in HD,"I was beyond ecstatic when Nintendo announced this collection.  Barebones? Yes, it is at times.  It would have been great to see the games rebuilt from the ground up, or remastered in their original format with additional flourishes regarding graphics and imagery.  At times, it seems like Nintendo just hit a button labeled UPSCALE GRAPHICS and poof!  This game popped out.  I am disappointed?  Absolutely NOT!  I'd rather have this than nothing.<br /><br />Mario 64 is probably the one that really needs to be built from the ground up again, but it is fine the way it is because this is how it originally was.  Gamers that never experienced this game back in the 90s because they weren't born yet shouldn't immediately dismiss it.  This is a true masterpiece and it was amazing to see such a huge leap from 2D to 3D done right.  The camera can be a bit janky at time, but still a great game regardless.<br /><br />Sunshine and Galaxy look amazing.  It is probably the best they will ever look unless Nintendo decides to do a hardcore 4K HD remaster.  Everything is upscaled and the visuals looks crisp, sharp, and clear.  Great to have these games is HD and happy to have them play on a modern day flat screen TV without red, white, and yellow cords.  Yes, you can use the pro controller (thank goodness) for Galaxy, but when certain touchscreen options come on screen, there is no other option but to remove it from dock mode.<br /><br />I do wish the DS and Wii New Super Mario Bros 2D games were on here along with Mario Galaxy 2, and New Super Mario Land 3D from the 3DS.  I hope these games will be considered for a future collection release.  Pick this and support them  You won't be disappointed.  These are all masterpieces and true treasures.  A mascot that has been in the game for 3 plus decades, and the best he'll ever look for a modern day console.

5.0,A fantastic Mario package for the Switch,"This collection doesn't have much to it aside from these three games and their soundtracks but honestly that is already one incredible package. This is also the fastest Switch game to boot up it's almost seamless from home to game which is pretty impressive. I will do a quick breakdown of each game and if they are superior to the original<br /><br />Mario 64 is a touch up of the Shindou version, this means it has some bug fixes but most importantly or at least the one change that stands out the most is Mario says ""bye bye"" when throwing bowser as oppose to ""so long king bowser"" overall, this is a great version to play but keep in mind it's the only game of this collection running at 30FPS<br /><br />Mario Sunshine is dressed up very nicely here and is running at a smooth 60 FPS 1080p but it does feel a bit weird to me. This might be a me thing as I didn't play much sunshine in the past but it's definitely a much better version of the game than the original as far as visuals and gameplay.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy has to be the best it's ever been here, once again 60FPS and 1080 the controls work great whether you are using the joy cons, the pro controller, or handheld. I will admit, handheld might be the least intuitive out of the three as you need to touch the screen to collect starbits.  However, the Switch version added your spin attack as it's own button now, which is really nice to have the only motion needed is for collecting bits<br /><br />Overall, awesome collection and I would love to see more of these from Nintendo",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFN7RMFT2BS6WD3R2E7GRHL36BXA,2020-09-22 01:21:29.813,2,True

3.0,Bare minimum effort.,"While recent patches have added a few options, such as inverted camera controls, and GameCube controller support, the rest of the package is basically a bare minimum effort. The ""All-Stars"" namesake bears little resemblance to the outstanding SNES compilation it borrows from. There's a couple minor updates (Mario 64 has a handful of higher resolution textures, including the typeface), but for the most part these are the original games running on in-house emulation, as opposed to native ports. Most players won't notice.<br /><br />If this is all you're expecting, and you don't consider Mario Galaxy 2 missing to be a problem, you won't be disappointed.

4.0,Might be worth-it if you've never played any of these games.,"I never played any of these 3 games until the purchase of this game cart.  I've also never owned the original consoles for which these games initially debuted.  While many in the comments will give their opinions based on specifications and nostalgia, I basically am giving this review as someone looking at this with fresh eyes/hands.<br /><br />Super Mario 64: it looks fine but the 3rd person camera placement is difficult to work with.  The graphics are solidly outdated, but if you've never played before, the mechanics aren't terrible.  It's ""good for what it is"", which is basically my way of saying that I might come back to it later.  I had similar camera troubles with Ocarina of Time for the 3DS.  I think I may just be too old to go back to this one.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine: the idea of having Mario/Princes/Character dialogue is interesting, but a little off-putting. The game itself is pretty fun. Unlike Mario U or 3DLand (mostly side scrolling), the worlds/levels feels far more open.  The mechanics took some time to get used to both docked and undocked, but I can say that I enjoyed playing this game. It feels like a not-mario Mario game.  In some ways I can see Breath of the Wild having been influenced by some design aspects of this game in particular.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy: I'm still getting used to this one, but it's a very fun game and graphically and gameplay wise a bit more interesting as well as advanced.  This one I haven't beaten, but I think I would already like to play the follow-up game as well (I hear it's quite good). This is probably the best of the 3, though I do enjoy Sunshine.<br /><br />Both of the latter play in full screen docked which is nice. Mario 64 seems to clip on the screen. This might be another reason why I'm irked by it (besides the camera work).<br /><br />In all I think $60 is good for both Sunshine and Galaxy combined as I had never played them before.  But if you have played them previously, as well as 64, $60 is a probably bit steep.  I feel like for this price, Nintendo could have leveled-up/refined the graphics somewhat.  But it is what it is and I can at least play this on the go.<br /><br />5 stars for trying to put 3 games in one cart.<br />2 stars for not bothering to update graphics.<br />5 stars for the fun of Galaxy and Sunshine.<br />1 star for Mario 64. It really feels half hearted.<br />3 stars for controls being a little strange.<br /><br />I would give it 3.5 stars, but I guess rounding up to the whole star is what I'll do, so 4 stars.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AEVR3HKOB7BE5T75SCGQWVVIOBMA,2020-09-22 23:37:32.563,0,True

1.0,Probably a hard pass unless you're here for nostalgia,"I'm only familiar with Mario 1-4 and Odyssey and a couple other 2d games from the series. Love old games and platinum'd Meat Boy, Sekiro, and nearly Death Stranding so I'm used to hard and frustrating, but holy cow 64 and Sunshine need quality of life updates BAD.<br />Played a bit of Mario 64 and had to stop because the camera is just awful and it has not aged well. Unless you're already really familiar I just don't see anyone enjoying it unless you REALLY like kinda clunky 3d platformers<br />I'm 33 stars into Sunshine and it's just such a slog getting kicked to the main area every single time you die that I'm already getting tired of it.<br />L1 brings up a map which has a 3 second animation to open and close every time you accidentally press it trying to long jump or whatever.<br />long unskippable cutscenes, slow text boxes<br />Your fludd nozzle gets changed anytime you go anywhere so i tend to fall to my death expecting to have the hover jets equipped constantly but nope.<br />It's by far the most charming 3d Mario I've played but it's rough.<br />Just started Galaxy and it still has the Wii UI and you have to use motion controls just to select a save spot and start the game. changing my rating to 1 star, i hate this and am going to sell it as soon as i get tired of Sunshine<br />Edit*<br />64 doesn't get better than just jumping around the castle for me, the levels are just not very fun.<br />Got 83 stars in Sunshine and im not bothering with the last 2 red coin missions. It's a buggy, untested game with lots of charm but it generally kinda sucks outside of aesthetics. Every problem I listed annoyed me the entire playthrough. Also every single thing involving yoshi is bad. Feeding him, the unmovable egg, spawn location, dying in water, and i think he just explodes when his fruit meter runs out? i honestly dont get why they even put him in this game. its just redundant with fludd, he jumps slightly higher and sprays water... cool.<br />Galaxy is weird. collecting sparkles sucks and it has the worst camera of the bunch, touchscreen is bad, button prompts are big shaking joycons, and the beginning is kinda awful. but once i started crawling around on the giant bee it got a lot better.

Higher frame rate, save states, wide screen, version choice, choice of controller, and custom button mapping are just a few ways emulation is better than this low-effort cash grab made all the more insulting by this collection displaying clear hallmarks of emulation.<br /><br />Previous collections on Nintendo consoles such as the the Megaman and Kirby collections (both originally $40) also have so much more for a far lower cost. Concept art, game commercials, trivia, in-game saving, cut scene skipping, new levels, and other additional content. None of which is here. The Kingdom Hearts collections included lost and region-locked content and were also only $40. The music player is nice, but it pales in comparison to the ability to save in a Megaman game right before a disappearing block section above instant-kill spikes.<br /><br />Mario 64- Rumble is on by default and can't be turned off. It is also the patched version, so no backwards long jump or ""So long'a bowser!"" The Megaman ZX collection proved DS games can be played on the Switch seamlessly, but this isn't the DS port of Mario 64, or the port of this version on the Wii-U.<br /><br />Mario Sunshine- Can't use gamecube controller on the gamecube game (these controllers work with Smash on Switch). The ""Secret of the Dirty Lakes"" mission has boundary boxes that only appear in the emulation process, so it is clear they emulated the game rather than remake it. They also messed with the controls.

There's no concept art, interviews, scans of the instruction manual, box art, basically anything other collections have done far better than this effort from Nintendo.

3.0,Quick cash grab,"So I played this the day before release, and found that on a 65"" TV, it doesn't really look all that great. This is considering the age of the games. You could do better by emulating this yourself on Dolphin and injecting your own textures. It's truly a cheap port and barely an improvement.<br /><br />The games as a whole are great. SM64 is as about as perfect as could be for a N64 Mario. Sunshine is actually the best, because it improved on 64 without straying too far from the linear fun of the Mario franchise. Galaxy would be more fun and better, if not for the gimmicky controls, and the repetitiveness of running around on tiny planets inappropriately called ""galaxies"".  They are all worth the roughly $20, if you didn't get to play one or all of these, and don't want the trouble of emulating it yourself.<br /><br />More on the physical aspect and Nintendo, the cartridge was actually ruined by the ESRB. Nintendo can't really control that, but you should know that the main logo is offset, and that will bother many people who overpay for this $60 piece of plastic. This game is supposed to be a ""limited print"", to celebrate Mario's 35 years, yet it is the sloppiest anniversary I've ever seen. It doesn't come with an actual sound track, no art, no steel book, cards, golden tickets, condoms, or even a simple thank you note. It's genuinely cheap through and through, and it's even more disappointing that the fact that there's still no new F-Zero, because at least they know not to do that if they can't do it right.<br /><br />Overall, it's only worth it if it's $60 or less, and if you're a normie who isn't picky with the quality of the physical game. Although, if this would at all eat into your budget for a PS5 or any of it's cost, just save your money. You will get far more enjoyment out of Demon's Souls.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AGUUY5BJZ66QRAIUTBHB4KPYUWSQ,2020-09-19 14:35:18.003,9,True

Super Mario 3D All Stars includes the three games mentioned above, as well as the official soundtracks to each game inside the software.<br /><br />One of my biggest disappointments with this is the seemingly lack of effort put into this collection for several reasons, including quality of life improvements and lack of extra content related to Mario’s 35th anniversary. At launch, the software felt rushed because of random glitches and slowdowns that weren’t even present in the original versions. These games are obviously running at a higher resolution than their original counterparts, so this should probably be expected- but these games are decades old now. Aside from emulation quirks that arise, you’d think that Nintendo would have put extra care and time into the development for this. I also think Nintendo could have done more things to improve upon the games, namely Mario Sunshine’s gameplay quirks- but I suppose that’s more forgiving if it involves changing source code.<br />There’s also not much content in terms of celebration. The soundtrack is all that is included, and it’s hard not to complain when past special editions included art books and physical soundtracks, or some kind of token- the last Mario anniversary release included these, albeit with a Super Nintendo game from the early ‘90s on a Wii disc, but it was priced ten dollars less.<br />It’s also inevitable to compare this collection to other similar software: Crash Bandicoot N. Same Trilogy and Spyro Remastered are two collections that completely REMAKE the original trilogies with new graphics, include extra content like development archives, and are priced at twenty dollars LESS than Super Mario 3D All-Stars. By no means should Nintendo have remade all three games, but the pricing of $59.99 left me confused and even felt cheated.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this if you really want to play these games on your Switch. I don’t think it’s a bad deal by any means, but it leaves a desire for more.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHINSBIY36ZU7Q7OTO32VKAVTFNQ,2021-04-19 18:21:14.996,0,True

1.0,Not worth $60,"This game is not worth the $60 it costs.  This game was emulated by nintendo to fit to the switch and it had no updates to it.  This means that the gameplay on the switch is just like it was on the N64, gamecube, or Wii. This is annoying in Mario 64, the first 3D game Nintendo came out with. They had not perfected the camera at that time and in 2020 the camera controls are still terrible.<br />There is also no more new content so you are paying $60 to Nintendo for work that they didn't really do.<br />You also cannot change the keys to any of the games, so in super mario sunshine i keep going to the map instead of doing a ground pound -  super frustrating. and the controls are not inverted on the switch even though they were inverted on the GC and theres no way to reverse them.<br />Super Mario Sunshine is also an aesthetically pleasing game with a great premise and FLUDD was a delight to get as a sequel to Mario 64, but my gosh the game is repetitive and frustrating.  I don't remember it being this bad as a kid.<br />I bought this game for nostalgia reasons but its honestly not worth $60.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFISB2EW6S2VZUHU4LDMLIWTWOEA,2020-11-09 21:28:10.999,0,False

4.0,3 Solid Games in a Kinda Barebones Collection,"Likes:<br />+Being able to play Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy on the same system in HD. You could only do this on the Wii in standard definition, so this is definitely a step up.<br />+All 3 titles look really clear.<br />+Sunshine is now in 16:9, which REALLY helps with the game IMHO.<br />+I actually disliked Sunshine's original inverted controls, so I like the fact that the camera and aiming is not inverted. This is just a me thing though as others dislike the lack of inverted controls.<br />+Galaxy has the spin tied to the Y button.<br />+Kinda minor, but the initial load from the Switch menu to the game menu is VERY quick. This is likely because the majority of the loading is done after you choose one of the games within the collection.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-Barebones UI for the menu.<br />-Lack of an Art Gallery and a Video Gallery that other collections like the Mega Man X Legacy Collection had. You just have the games and the soundtracks.<br />-Would've liked a remastered port or remake like what Crash and Spyro had instead of 3 emulations, but you get what you can get with Nintendo.<br />-I dislike the fact that this is a limited release as this will encourage scalpers to buy everything until there's no stock remaining and then sell it at a higher price.<br />-No more ""So Long, King Bowser!"" or backwards long jump glitch for speedrunning. Minor gripes, but still gripes.<br />-Weird editing for Fludd's explanation of how the controls work in Sunshine.<br /><br />Overall, a solid collection, but it could be a bit better. I'd recommend grabbing it before scalpers do.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFJ2WDSW2ZWYW6ZRPQFUIDJKESLQ,2020-09-22 22:34:34.341,1,True

2.0,"Great games, disappointing anniversary celebration...","Mario is 3 years my senior he's someone I've grown up with my whole life and to see his 35th birthday be celebrated in this way is a little disappointing. Why is super Mario All-Stars from super NES not on this I'll never understand, why is there not more music could they not have included the entire library of music from all the Mario games instead of just these games. This was the first video game I've ever pre-ordered due to the fact that it was going to be limited release and I didn't want to miss a copy of it because I do love Mario that much and I enjoy these games that much and I want a copy of them for my switch that I will always have and that I will never lose, but I feel like this was so underwhelming and the problem lies in the fact that Nintendo doesn't understand how important anniversaries are in the Western world maybe. A 35th anniversary deserves a real fanfare and while I'll probably get the pen set for pre-ordering this and doing everything else that just doesn't seem like enough to me and I would have paid for a premium packaging of this that included artwork or something. This was just a little bit too underwhelming for me and unfortunately I had no other choice but to buy it now or potentially pay a premium to have it in the future.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Orqq3BaLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Orqq3BaLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Orqq3BaLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XHB9lvWxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XHB9lvWxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XHB9lvWxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHDA5FTG7HXJ5YTJM5DMVVGAYYJA,2020-09-19 15:55:18.577,1,True

5.0,The absolute best way to experience 3 classic Mario games,"This is the best way to experience these games, period. The games have all been upscaled to HD resolution and they look amazing because of it. In my opinion Super Mario Galaxy benefits the most from this, it is an already beautiful game that is finally in full 1080p resolution. I should note every game here controls EFFORTLESSLY on Nintendo Switch. The controls for Super Mario 64 are especially impressive, considering how poorly the game ran on Wii and Wii U. Super Mario Sunshine gets a much needed widescreen addition, which really helps the game. And for those of you concerned with how Galaxy has been adapted, rest assured the game works great (if not even better) with the option to use traditional controls instead of motion controls. My only gripe with this collection is the lack of Super Mario Galaxy 2, which I  desperately hoping is added down the line as paid DLC. The collection lacks a lot of features used to flesh out other collections (such as a museum or a promotional material showcase), but I personally believe this collection is perfectly fine without it.

2.0,"Charming, yet clunky.","When this collection was first announced, I was pretty stoked. During my childhood, Mario kind of flew under my radar and I was more interested in Zelda and Pokemon, so I planned on this game hopefully giving me an introduction into some classic 3D Nintendo nostalgia. Let it be known that I bought this digitally.<br /><br />Right away I could tell that they were all ports. Most, if not all the controls do not feel optimized for the Switch at all, especially Mario 64. I haven't played Sunshine yet, but Mario Galaxy has to be my favorite of the three. God, what a beautiful game that's slightly ruined by the fact that, yet again, the controls could use some work being adapted to the Switch. Motion is very bad, and collecting the stars still feels like it should be with the Wiimote.<br /><br />Overall, I get what Nintendo was trying to do with this collection.

If you were to buy Mario 64 physical for the n64 it could cost you $30-$35 , Mario Sunshine could cost you an easy $50 & Mario Galaxy can easily cost you $30 so in total if you bought them individually it would cost you over $100. For just $60 you get all 3 games with full HD 800p to 1080p in dock mode & 720p mobile. You can tell the difference especially when you play mario galaxy which originally on the wii you were getting 420i & now to get 1080p is amazing. If you lied to me & said that it's a next gen mario game , I'd be fooled.<br />They throw in digital soundtracks for all 3 games & then you have the fact it can be played on the go.<br /><br />Cons.<br />The bare bones job Nintendo did is shameful. This is supposed to be a 35th anniversary so where's the manual ? An art book ? A physical soundtrack ? Perhaps a mini figure ? Where's Mario Galaxy 2 ?<br /><br />Final thoughts.<br />If you looking for a decent platformer compilation, you can always count on mario & super mario 3d all-stars is good enough to satisfy that itch. It's 3D-fic 👌","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710wRMgw3gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710wRMgw3gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710wRMgw3gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TM3KyiAGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TM3KyiAGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TM3KyiAGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFOICS2T3HG3PXDSBD2NVXGRX3HA,2020-09-20 02:15:50.603,0,False

1.0,Just a lazy cash grab from Nintendo.,"I have been a die hard Nintendo fan since at least age 7, and fondly remember playing these games when they originally came out. I was stoked by the rumors that there'd be a 3D Mario Collection, imagining everything it could have been. Instead, what we got was a lazy port of 3 games with only the bare minimum level of enhancement. I get that Nintendo was trying to go all preservationist as they do with their classic NES and SNES games, but the fact is, 3D games, especially early 3D games, just don't age as gracefully as the previous generations did. Take Super Mario 64, for instance. Much like Super Mario Bros., this was a genre-defining game and was mind-blowing at the time. The original Super Mario Bros. remains a near-perfect platformer to this day. But when Super Mario 64 came out, 3D platformers still had a lot to work out, and they have grown and evolved since then in almost every way, leaving this game in the dust. And as a result, it's almost unplayable today. No, I'm not going to repeat the classic complaints about it not being in widescreen or the graphics being blocky. I can see past those things, and to be honest I forget that it's even in 4:3 almost as soon as I start playing. I'm talking about things like having modern camera controls. This would have been one of the easiest things to implement, and it would have made the game SO much more enjoyable. Instead, I have to deal with endless frustration of missed jumps due to not being able to see Mario or his surroundings properly. As I said, in 1996 this game was amazing, but this isn't 1996, and I'm not playing it on an N64 with an N64 controller. In 2020 it comes off feeling broken and borderline unplayable. These three games, and Super Mario 64 in particular deserved better. The Mario franchise deserved better. And most of all, Nintendo fans deserved better. I'm just sad that so many people buy this game up and continue to rave about it. Just face the facts- Nintendo dropped the ball on this one, and unless people start to admit it, this won't be the last time.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFUW7LXUQYDF2ASTLQQKQ5GR2XBQ,2020-11-08 16:32:35.298,0,False

5.0,So worth it!!!,"The first time I played Mario 64 I was 10 years old. It was one of the first console games I had ever played.

Getting to replay the same levels from my childhood and making the same mistakes, but also playing better and getting stars that used to be impossible for me to get is pretty cool. Kind of like having a conversation with your younger self. Playing this game in this format was very fulfilling for me. That said, the camera is a bit difficult to deal with.

4.0,"If you enjoy these games or LOVE Mario, than this is great.","All three games are good/great. I grew up playing Sunshine and Galaxy and 64 is a classic. Its easy to switch between games. I recommend playing with the pro controller on the big screen as much as possible. I personally think 64 has a difficulty curve with the controls and fighting the camera. Sunshine got the biggest graphical overhaul. galaxy has the biggest change in controls(uses the gyro in the controller for aiming the cursor or touch if playing in handheld). the music is great, especially in galaxy. Galaxy is the easiest of the games. I had a harder time playing 64 but sunshine has some difficult challenging levels (a pachinko machine and a lily pad level come to mind.)<br /><br />I personally think 64 is a bit over hyped and dated but good. Sunshine is great for the most part. Galaxy is as good as it has ever been.

3.0,A lazy compilation,"I bought this mainly because I wanted to replay Super Mario 64.<br /><br />Playing Super Mario 64 for the first time in 1996 is one of my best videogame memories. The game was absolutely stunning at that time, no other 3d platformer was nearly as good.<br />25 years later... I'm glad to re-play this but certain aspects of the game really didn't age well.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is the camera. Wow, does the camera stink in this game!  It was really innovating to be able to control the camera back in the days that you'd look past it's flaws, but by today's standards it's just very messy and not ok. It just sometimes refuse to move or stay where you want to stay in areas where precision is required. Not a deal breaker but it's certainly frustrating.<br /><br />Overall Mario 64 still has magical moments, it's certainly a classic and I mostly enjoyed playing through it, some parts of the game and certain textures are actually surprisingly pretty, like inside the pyramid (and has very little to do with the resolution increase in the port). And the music is still awesome.<br />But Nintendo really should have at least fixed the camera and some of the uglier textures if they didn't want to do bother with a (well deserved) remake to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Coming up with a follow up to Mario 64 that wouldn't disappoint fans was a very hard endeavor even if Nintendo tried hard, and I don't think they really did it with Mario Sunshine. Wasn't a favorite when it was originally released on the Gamecube and I still dont care much for it. Unlike 64, the game's graphics aged surprisingly well though.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy is the best of the bunch, the spiritual successor to Super Mario 64. I played this so much on the Wii that I still don't feel ready to fully replay this game, but if you didnt play any of those games before it's for sure the best. The formula was improved even more on Mario Galaxy II - why the heck isn't it included here??<br /><br />Overall it's hard to review this. It's a collection of very lazy ports of fantastic games. No interesting extras just the soundtrack.<br />Super Mario 64 especially should really have been cleaned up (poor camera, some ugly textures)<br />I recommend this if you are really  craving some nostalgia time with any of the games in the collection.

5.0,Classic's ....... nuff said,"Best versions since the originals and I would say better in some cases. If your a collector or grew up with these games this is a must own. If you played other mario games but not these, give em a shot .... they are timeless.<br /><br />Mario 64 - yah it 4:3..... so was the original. Its been cleaned up and upscaled to 720p. Could they have done better.... maybe but its still an amazing game. Slow down present in the Wii-U version is none existent so this make the best version you can buy.<br />Mario Sunshine - Never looked better. Upgraded to full HD widescreen it looks great and probably the most straight forward to play. While some didn't like the original I still think its a gem and well worth the time.<br />Mario Galaxy - The most recent also the best looking. Controls are a bit wonky but the mind bending puzzles are unlike anything you see in other Mario games.<br /><br />In summery.... if your a collector or plan to play it mobile buy the cartridge. If not buy the download .... but don't wait too long as 1st party Nintendo titles don't depreciate in price like other systems or games.

3.0,Classic collection but perhaps only for old fans,"A simple emulation/port of three older 3D Mario games.  I'm not a Mario fanboy, and I never played these growing up so I was excited and curious to try them for the first time.  I knew they were ports or emulations or whatever, but even a few QoL changes would have been welcome.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the classic M64 just doesn't hold up for a first-timer and Mario is so fiddly and twitchy plus poor camera control makes it hard to appreciate it for what I am sure it once was.  Mario Sunshine looks nice but suffers from some strange mechanics and I frankly didn't play it much and would even argue M64 is a better experience.  Galaxy is probably my favorite as it appears this is when Nintendo finally polished up the 3D experience and will probably be the only one I'll finish.<br /><br />In hindsight, I somewhat regret spending $60 on this, but fans of the originals should enjoy this.  5/5 for classic reasons, but 2/5 for modern enjoyment.  Maybe I just don't have patience for fussy platformers anymore and I kept thinking I'd rather be playing something else more refined.  Hard to recommend when there are so many other great games out now worth $60 or less.  Finally, it really offers nothing for people who are new to the old series to generate any enthusiasm or interest so it is basically a nostalgia cash-in.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AEFCPOYTKDQOBIKO5FDRFBKMNTTQ,2020-09-19 02:36:18.877,4,True

The graphics of Super Mario Galaxy look fantastic in HD. The motion controls of Super Mario Galaxy worked well in both tabletop mode and docked mode, despite the Switch not having a sensor bar like the Wii. Some people have stated that the lack of a sensor bar ruins the motion controls in Super Mario Galaxy, but I had no problems with them.<br /><br />CONS<br />I was expecting Nintendo to provide some enhancements to each game in this collection, much like how the original Super Mario All-Stars consisted of enhanced remakes of the original NES games. I knew that Nintendo was probably not going to completely remake these games from scratch, but I was hoping that Nintendo would at least improve the controls and the user interface.<br /><br />Instead, this collection consists of glorified emulation. I found myself constantly fighting the camera controls in both Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario 64 is not even rendered with a 16:9 aspect ratio, so it looks even more dated.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />If I wanted to play Super Mario 64 just as it appeared in 1996, I would have simply powered-up my Wii U and played the Virtual Console version of it. If I wanted to play Super Mario Galaxy just as it appeared in 2007, I would have simply powered-up my Wii U, booted into Wii mode, and then inserted my Super Mario Galaxy disc. I expected this release to offer something new, and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have waited until watching gameplay footage before dropping $60 on this game. However, I pre-ordered this game because I feared that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited release window, this title would be difficult to buy later-on. Essentially, I got played by Nintendo's low-effort money grab.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHBAPX4JJQKYTMNTKVQ3K7NMOXNA,2021-03-22 01:53:08.672,0,False

This time they decided to just upscale the graphics a little, add the word “limited release”, and charged us full price for decades old games.

This product was not supposed to “fix” the original games. It was intended to give us the ability to play games that are essentially lost, on a console that everyone now has at their disposal. I myself still have my N64, but I doubt the majority of the population does. As for “fixing” camera ability or “remastering the quality” why would you? People buy arcade machines to play games older than myself. Why? Because you play a game in its original aesthetic and appreciate it as is. There are games that were never ported, and once I lost them, I will never be able to play them again. We have a plethora of new, flashy, trendy games coming out in spades every year.

3.0,Only For Diehard Mario Fans,"As a huge fan of Nintendo and Mario games, I was really looking forward to this collection. I had previously played all three of these titles on their original consoles, so I was curious to see how they upgraded the camera and controls. I soon discovered the answer: they didn't. All three games are straight ports of the originals with a resolution upgrade and little else. They did add a music player so you can listen to the music from all three games, and while that's kind of cool, in practice who actually uses this feature?<br /><br />The resolution on Super Mario 64 is sharper but the textures are still from 1996 which results in some sharp UGLY textures. And man is the camera ever horrible. I can understand that this was Mario's first 3D adventure, so I forgave the original for having a camera that's difficult to control and at times unresponsive. But in a collection such as this, I think it's pure laziness on Nintendo's part that the camera controls were not at least modernized to eliminate some of the original's issues. It is mapped to the R stick but the responsiveness is the same as when it was mapped to the N64's ""C"" buttons. It will swing wildly behind Mario at inopportune times and obscure what's in front of you. It's hard to position to see far enough out during the platform sections, so you often will miss a jump. And when you do try to reign it in, it will often get stuck on the landscape and not move at all. Mario himself still controls like his clunky '96 self, so he tends to slide quite a bit when trying to stop and making precise movements with him over a narrow platform is often a lesson in patience.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine benefits more from the resolution bump and looks beautiful in the new expanded aspect ratio. It appears they did not upgrade the in game movie parts however and it's pretty obvious from their blurry appearance. This is a bit of nit picking however. Unfortunately, the game again suffers from lazy control ports. While the F.L.U.D.D. was easy to control with the original Gamecube controller, the button mapping is now awkward and has a steep learning curve before you truly feel even a little bit comfortable with it. One button lets you fire in place and control the up and down with the L controller. Another button lets you fire and strafe, and yet another lets you fire straight ahead while running. I often times was completely frustrated by the lack of control I had over the stream in boss fights and during platforming sections (Hotel Lobby...!!) and can't help to think there could have a been a better option for the controls. It's hard to remember what button does what and often results in moving Mario when I meant to leave him in place or vice versa in the heat of the moment. The camera is the same as the original, and while it's a marked improvement over Mario 64's, it still is a product of it's time and is often difficult to line it up precisely in the platforming sections or while using the hover attachment. So be prepared to fall often.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy suffers the least in this collection and what is already one of Mario's most gorgeous looking adventures is even better looking with the resolution upgrade. There are motion controls in the game, which I'm not sure could be changed given the original Wii's remote, but they are implemented about as well as you can expect. The camera in this one won't give you many issues, because it's excellent compared to the previous two games. It moves with the action and is always about where you need it to be. Corrections that are needed are usually only small adjustments one way or the other. And while all three games have a great soundtrack, this one really shines and is one of my favorites of all Mario games.<br /><br />There is a certain nostalgia factor that is included with these games for people such as myself, so regardless of the lazy collection, I will still play it. And that's what Nintendo seems to bank on. While the original Super Mario All Stars featured upgraded graphics and small control tweaks, Nintendo seems to think this is no longer necessary even though one only needs to look to the internet to know how good Mario 64 could look given a little extra TLC. Also, the absence of Galaxy 2 is puzzling and a little disappointing. If these Mario collections are supposed to truly be ""a collection"", then why leave parts out? I fully suspect they are planning a re-release like they are doing with Super Mario 3D World in order to milk a little more money out of diehards like myself.<br /><br />So for those that have fond memories and an affinity for all things Mario, you're probably going to buy this anyway. But for those looking to experience these games for the first time, I'm not sure this is the right experience. You would be better off playing them on their original consoles so you can use the original control scheme mapped to each consoles unique controllers.

3.0,Great. Nintendo could've done better,"I have never played the originals. So when I picked up this version, this was going to be the first time I have played any of the 3 games. I have not played galaxy yet (nor have I played galaxy 2 for that matter) and will update this when I do. Played sunshine first. Didnt have much issues and beat the game. What I really had a problem with were the platform levels. The platform levels felt harder than they should and probably will be the only reason I wont collect all the stars. I played mario 64 next and I have not beaten it yet. Right now I'm at 102 stars. Keep in mind that all 3 of these games at literally ports. They're not remastered or remakes. They're the same copies as the original besides different controls. Think the only drastic thing they changed were the frame rates. So when I say the camera still sucksz it really still sucks. You can jump onto a platform above you and the camera will still be stuck underneath and it is a STRUGGLE to fix it so you can see where you are going. You also dont have much room to look around with the camera. The controls are also not that good. If you press down on the left analog stick too much while mario is looking foward, mario will still walk in that direction. I have accidently walked off cliffs because of this. In mario 64, It felt like they couldve done more with a 25 year old game and it just feels like they didnt really touch it much. With sunshine, it feels like they didnt play through the whole game to test it. The games are the same mario games you all know and love otherwise.

4.0,It's a collection of 3-D Mario Games!,"It's the first 3 3-D Mario games in one collection! What's not to love?<br /><br />Well, a few things. First, the games have only been lightly touched up graphically; Nintendo could have done a lot more to make the games look better on the Switch (this is really apparent on Mario 64, that does not play in full screen). Given that Nintendo has released past games in HD, it feels like they dropped the ball on this collection. Second, the Switch controls weren't adapted too well for these games. Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine feel ""slippery""; the controls are too sensitive for these games, and you will get frustrated when a simple action (like walking/running in a straight line) is impossible. For Mario Galaxy, the game uses the touch screen when played in hand held which is... interesting (I kinda liked it, but I can see how others will find it disappointing). When played on the TV, the Joy-Cons have use the motion control and pointing that the Wii used but with one MAJOR difference: They are not optically aiming at the screen, but rather ""mimicking"" such action, meaning that they don't point exactly where you intend them to. This is exasperated when using a Pro-Controller. The motion control parts of the game (like Ray Surfing or riding the Star Ball) also control weirdly. I honestly wish they would have re-done the control schemes for these so that you didn't have to rely on the motion controls alone.<br /><br />The last thing about this collection is Nintendo's announcement of when it will be discontinued. I can see them making a limited production run for the physical copies, but there is no reason to remove the game from E-Store other than creating artificial scarcity.<br /><br />Despite all this, I would still recommend the collection. It is probably the best way to get these games legally for the foreseeable. If you don't have the original hardware or don't want to buy expensive copies on the used market, then this is the best solution. All three games in the collection are fantastic (even with all the flaws I mentioned above).

1.0,Poorly emulated cash-grab,"First off, the marketing tactic of making this a ""limited time release"" did not sit well with me.  I'm actually fine with Nintendo repackaging these classics as a cash grab, but using false scarcity to drive up demand is shady.<br /><br />However, my kids are obsessed with Mario (Odyssey and Deluxe) and I thought I would swallow my objections so they could experience Mario from my youth (Mario 64).  I wasn't too bothered with the fact that they hadn't remastered anything, I figured that would ensure smooth performance...I was wrong.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when excitedly powering on Mario 64 for the first time in 20 years (aside from the incredible delta between the graphics I remember in my head vs what was pictured on my screen) was the lag.  If I'm trying to emulate a game on my Rasberry Pi, that kind of lag is frustrating, but understandable.  If I'm playing a 25 year old game I paid $60 for on a $300 console, then that is just inexcusable.  Mario Sunshine was also painfully laggy, and Galaxy was OK.<br /><br />How did Nintendo not put any money towards optimizing the performance?  How is a $300 ""modern"" console with four 1GHz CPUs outperformed by a 25 year old console a single 100MHz CPU.  I understand the emulation overhead, but with what they are charging for this, they should have ported the source code instead of emulating.<br /><br />I feel bad for rewarding Nintendo with this purchase.  I returned it after our poor experience, but Amazon only gave me a partial refund.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AF5N6RMC45UGMP37Q6W2VJ2LWJJQ,2021-03-15 21:14:21.144,1,True

Why is something like an emulator able to make it widescreen, but an official emulator from Nintendo can't? There is no reason for that. As for it being a timed-release with an end date. I feel like they're going to do what they did with Super Mario All-Stars, 25th anniversary for the Wii, but as a virtual console. I feel like all three of these games will be used to launch their virtual console in 2021!

5.0,"A must-have for older Mario fans, and maybe even newer ones","If you're a fan of Mario's older 3D platforming titles, then you simply MUST do yourself a favor and pick a copy of this game. And if you're younger, I'd still recommend to seriously consider picking up a copy - to better appreciate how far Mario has come in his epic 3D adventures, and simply because some of his older stuff remains a blast to play to this day.<br /><br />Three classic games in one is tough to beat.  And even years later, I think all three titles are a blast to play.<br /><br />Nintendo enhanced the look of all three titles, so the graphics look a little nicer. And I find that gameplay for all three games transitions pretty well on the Switch console.<br /><br />Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine play pretty well for me on the Switch Pro Controller. And for the most part, I find Super Mario Galaxy works well with the detached joycons. The motion controls can take a little getting used to, but I find after a little while it begins to feel natural.<br /><br />I would say Super Mario 64 hasn't aged perfectly well. The 1996-era graphics, awful camera and at times finicky controls can be frustrating. But this is still a very fun game - I'm also a sucker for nostalgia.<br /><br />I have never played Super Mario Sunshine prior to it being in released on 3D All-Stars, and I must say that it is both terrific and frustrating at the same time. The game has aged well graphically, and the environments, movements and levels are a bunch of fun. Be warned though, if you're a casual game like me, this game can immensely frustrating at times. Some levels are brutal in difficulty (IMO), but persevering through the tougher ones does feel incredibly rewarding. I'm so glad I played this game.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun on Super Mario Galaxy back in the late 2000s, and the game still looks and plays fantastic to this day. The graphics are still quite pleasing, the levels are highly intriguing, and the overall gameplay is so much fun. This is one of Mario's best adventures for sure. The difficulty is balanced well. Some levels can be pretty tricky, and a few can be considered downright difficult, but you don't have to be amazing to beat this game. This may be the best title among the the trio of games on 3D All-Stars.<br /><br />Overall, I've had a blast re-exploring two classic Mario titles, while discovering the world of Super Mario Sunshine for the very first time. Getting three awesome titles for $60 bucks is a great deal - and if you aim to beat each one 100%, the hours you can sink in will definitely give you your money's worth. Plus, each title has pretty darn good replay value.<br /><br />So please, if you're a fan of Nintendo's iconic Italian plumber - whether hard core or simply casually - do yourself a favor and buy 3D All-Stars. I don't think you'll regret it at all.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AGDE7WJHECAISUADCT2ZSOMP6LJQ,2020-10-18 17:55:06.030,2,True

3.0,The only reason you bought this is because Nintendo’s limited release.,"This game set is bland as hell, and not worth 60 dollars.<br /><br />I can play an hd remake of Mario 64 on pc for absolutely free, I can play Mario Sunshine on GameCube and add hdmi for a better experience overall, and the fact that Mario Galaxy 2 isn’t here is disgraceful.<br /><br />I saw MANY copies of this being sold physically at Best Buy, so I know for a fact this game is easier to get than it seems, Nintendo’s forced scarcity is just a way to push people into buying something they would’ve otherwise passed on.<br /><br />I bought this for the same reason. I’m not crazy about Mario to begin with, but I didn’t wanna miss out on owning this in my collection.<br /><br />This Christmas I’m getting a mod kit called the G Boy Rev III, a kit designed to turn a Nintendo wii into a handheld that plays all its games digitally. And on that console, I’ll be able to play Mario Sunshine, Mario Galaxy, AND Mario Galaxy 2, all on native hardware for the best latency and frame rate possible, as well as a perfectly suitable emulation of Mario 64.<br /><br />In other words, I don’t NEED this collection. I bought it BECAUSE it’s limited release.

U do have 2 different buttons for shooting ur water cannon... 1 for stationary and other for while moving since the switch doesnt have analog triggers like the gamecub controller did.. believe u can fix that by getting a gb controller model or adaptor. Galaxy looks the best its ever been and its nice to finally play it wo motion controls for attacking... the gyro feature for collecting star bits is a bit awkward.. I definitely prefer the Precision of the Wii remote over the gyro. Motion controls r back for squid racing, was a little bummed... but oh well, the positives still out way the negatives and if u dont see motion controls as a negative then ur all set.

2.0,Appreciate the thought but no thanks,"Mario games' history is a wonderful one. Yet here is Nintendo, is milking it to the max here and being greedy with the limited time purchase policy (which has worked unfortunately). This collection has 2 ways to be a good product: $39.99 MSRP or galaxy 2 to be included.<br /><br />Now, the product as it is now contains 3 titles:<br /><br />- Mario 64: Oh god does it hurt to look at it now. Nostalgic factor is not enough to save this one. Couldn't play more than 30 min before I quit for good.<br /><br />- Sunshine: It's good, but nothing more than a filter to blur some rough edges this game has been treated. It shows it's age but still playable.<br /><br />- Galaxy: this is the game to play out of this collection. Since it's the newest of them, it looks good.<br /><br />So I advise not to buy it for a single port and not to feed Nintendo's greed and make them do a better job as they should be",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFLVCQEBXN4J65ENHORBNYRMCBZA,2021-01-03 21:20:36.123,0,True

Before the collection I did own Galaxy but roughly remember it due to my lack of time involved. The game was a much better experience then I expected utilizing graphics which are close to odyssey which by itself already makes up the price point. Although there’s a lack of issues when it comes to saving the game for the 3 games, I feel as if the switch is capable towards making the times of saving much faster. If you were to buy the game for sunshine or 64, go ahead! The games are as well amazing but lack more issues compared to Galaxy. Overall, they can all be played in a different controller setup which first timers may not see a problem with especially because of how these games still play amazingly when not talking about the 64’s lack of camera angles sunshine’s 30fps frame rate.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AEHXGDUMMPF4CD3WHUSD7VRDITHA,2021-03-24 05:22:17.574,0,True

2.0,Please read before you buy.,"So I did not buy this from Amazon. But I feel like I have to write a review for everyone. I loved Mario 64. Always have and always will. I  beat it around 20 times on Nintendo 64. Maybe 5-10 times on wii and Wii U ( All 120 stars). I consider it as one of the greatest games of all time, Next to goldeneye 007. When this came out I was so excited until I played it. The graphics are the same as I remembered. That’s fine with me. The camera sucks as I’m used to. Again I’m fine with that. That’s the game I’m used to. The thing I can’t get past is the controls. They are either too touchy or non responsive. Again I have beat the game a lot. I know what I’m doing, I know everything about the game. But the way the controls work, it makes it almost unplayable. I’m pretty bummed out about the game because it had potential. But save your money or wait for them to do an update and fix it. Some of the easiest levels are unbeatable or really, really hard. I’m only at 32 stars and not even past level 8. I want to keep playing because I love it, but it’s hard to play when you can’t even wall jump without it being non responsive. Or when you get the flying cap you can’t triple jump. That’s just a few problems. There are many, many more. Hope this helps on your purchase.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AFF24PX724QRM2L6XCABNPGN5EPQ,2020-11-22 02:22:34.335,0,False

5.0,Objectiviely Fantastic Rereleases of All Time Classics,"Super Mario 3D All Stars is a great collection to relive some of Mario's greatest adventures. The collection comes with 3 games that all are built to control on the Switch. Super Mario 64 has added rumble, patches a few bugs and has some quality of life additions. While there isn't things like widescreen for Super Mario 64; Nintendo removed the ugly blur filter that all N64 games have and as a result it looks a lot more smooth and clear for the Nintendo Switch. Something I don't hear a whole lot of people talk about is how this is a version of Super Mario 64 we NEVER got for North America. It's called the ""Shindou Version"" that like I said about adds rumble support & patches a few things which I must say the HD rumble feels nice everytime Mario performs and action. It isn't distracting and really makes you feel like you're in the game.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine is a game that not everyone is able to play, but now can thanks to this being the first time It's EVER been released on another platform by Nintendo. It now has widescreen support, which is nice but to me I don't feel it's necessary personally. The game is scaled up to 1080p and looks great for being a gamecube game! While Super Mario Sunshine is a rough & challenging game to play to this day, it certainly is a unique experience you won't find anywhere else and I'd say buying this collection alone for Sunshine is worth it due to Gamecube prices skyrocketing!<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy has been outfitted to run nearly natively on the Switch console and out of the 3 games has the most work done for it due to the Wii's complicated nature. You can now control the pointer functions using the Joycon and even the pro controller! All of it is motion based and you no longer need a sensor bar to control said pointer. If the pointer gets out of sync, you can easily reset it with a press of a button. Not to mention, motion controls are no longer required to play this game; you can now spin Mario with also just a press of a button.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this collection is worth it to relive these great classic games from my childhood. I would drop a star due to in shipping a small portion of my physical copy was damaged but, recently Amazon refunded me $10 due to having per-ordered it and they price matched. Very nice of them so I'm keeping this at 5 stars instead of dropping it by one. The collection might not be for everyone, but I would say if you are young and have always wanted to play one of these 3 all time classics, go for it.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AHSEOFSXNUTJTPMLM6ZG5EJ7O3DA,2020-09-19 19:37:14.294,1,True

4.0,Would be excellent if it had customizable controls,"With the addition of controls customization, this would be an easy 5 stars from me. You know these games, you know they’re great, and since you clicked here, you want them in a nice convenient package to play all three on your Switch. If you come into it knowing and accepting this compilation is minimal in terms of extras, you are going to have a great time.<br /><br />Upon firing up the game, you get a little juxtaposition of Mario obtaining a star/shine sprite in all three games, and it plays the jingle for getting a star in Super Mario Galaxy. Simple, but I like it, and it does a good job at getting you excited to revisit these games.<br /><br /> The game select menu gives you a brief summary of each game, and plays a song picked at random from one of the three soundtracks. Neat touch! You can also access all three soundtracks and pick whichever song you would like to play while in the menu. This is basically the one “extra feature” of the set.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, my biggest complaint is the fact that you can’t customize the controls. The controls are responsive, and are probably the best ones they could have picked as a single control scheme to please everyone, but for people used to the originals, there is just a little bit of getting used to that could have been bypassed if they had some sort of “original controls” option.<br /><br />For Super Mario 64, I like the higher sensitivity in the joy con sticks to the original N64 analog stick. This makes it easier to turn on a dime, which especially helps for doing the flip jump, which was sometimes difficult to consistently perform in the original.<br /><br />However, the one part of the game that is MORE difficult to control, as a result of the sensitivity, is aiming the cannon. Thankfully, you’re not on any time limit when doing this, but I found it more difficult to make smaller adjustments to the projectile angle without having it moving way farther than intended. ALSO, most players would probably like this, but the cannon aiming is no longer done with inverted controls, which takes a bit of time for old farts like me to get used to. Again, I know I’m likely in the minority, and it didn’t absolutely ruin the game or anything, but I would have greatly appreciated the option to customize the controls here to my liking.<br /><br />As for Super Mario Sunshine, you again no longer have inverted controls for aiming your water stream when using F.L.U.D.D. Same point as above: doesn’t ruin the game, but I would have liked the option to play it as I remembered. However, one change is that now there are two different buttons for shooting water. More specifically, to fix your position and shoot, hold R, and to shoot while moving, hold ZR. This is much more precise than the original, in which these distinct shooting options were toggled by how far down you pressed R, which led to a fair number of situations in which you unintentionally employ the wrong style of shooting. I like this change a lot, except for one strange consequence. Since playing requires using ZR, you cannot use a Gamecube controller.<br /><br />That’s right, you cannot use the controller this game was originally designed for DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SWITCH SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO CONNECT ONE USING AN ADAPTER. What a lost opportunity! Again, this could have been very easily remedied by allowing you to remap this function to a different button that is available on the GameCube controller, or else by simply allowing for a “classic controls” option.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy...well, to be honest, I’m not too far yet, but I don’t have any issues with the default controls! You can easily play with one joy con in each hand to replicate the original feeling of having a Wii remote in one hand, and the nunchuck in the other. In addition, for those who dislike motion controls, you can now perform the essential spin action with the y button instead of shaking the joy con, though the latter also serves this function if you prefer. Again, this shows how the other ports could have been truly excellent by simply allowing the player to choose how they would most like to control our favorite plumber.<br /><br />As for the rest of the details about how these ports are handled, I have no complaints. The graphics show some age, but have been smoothed out a bit, most noticeably in Super Mario 64, which looks much less “polygonal.” The frame rate is also higher and more consistent, which again is most noticeable in Super Mario 64. I swore at first that the game speed must have been higher! Likewise, there have been fixes to slowdown issues noticeable in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. Super Mario Sunshine now has subtitles (can be turned off if you prefer), which is great because there are moments in the game where the mixing on the voice tracks are not very clear. I was NEVER able to understand what those cops told Mario after leaving the cell when I played the original! I think some of the sound effects in Super Mario 64, like Mario’s “wha!” when jumping, have a higher pitch than the original, but I might just be crazy. Even if I’m not, you’d have to be a pretty picky originalist to care. Oh, and no more “so long, King Bowser!” when you throw him by the tail in Super Mario 64. A more noticeable change, but again, it would be a nitpick to complain about, and people who know what I’m talking about know exactly why Nintendo would opt to change this. I haven’t played through these games entirely, so there might be other slight changes, but I trust that they would be trivial.<br /><br />So there you have it, all three games and what you can expect from them. No save states, no display or audio customizability, no additional unlockables or challenges, no extensive galleries or fun facts (aside from the blurbs for the games on the select screen), and most importantly to me, no options for changing the controls. However, all games are very cleanly emulated, have responsive controls, and are still a blast to play. For some, this is the only realistic option to play these games, and buying this package is a no-brainer. As for those who already own some or all of the original games and consoles, you’re probably the best judge of how much value you’ll get from this set. Just remember not to wait too long. As you may already know, it won’t be available for purchase physically or digitally after March 2021. I really, really wish that Nintendo didn’t arbitrarily impose this limited availability for people who might want to wait longer or aren’t Switch owners yet, but that’s another story.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AGSWG3NYEQI7GN6OHG3OPHTNBCUQ,2020-09-21 23:43:07.977,11,True
3.0,"Great being able to play these games on the switch, but some weird decisions from nintendo.","Let me start by saying I don't mind that this is just a couple emulators that Nintendo threw together under a $60 price tag. In my opinion I'm paying for the ability to play these great games on my switch wherever I take it. Yes I can get emulators for all these games on a computer, but lugging a computer or laptop around on travel is far less convenient than using a switch. That combined with the how well Mario Galaxy works with the pro controller/joycons, you can't really replicate that in emulation.<br /><br />All 3 games seem to play well. The updated sprites and resolution look nice especially when displayed on a TV. Where things start to fall apart are the control setups. I'm not sure why they did this, but they bound A and B to the same buttons in the games. This is really weird and feels unnatural. They were obviously trying to make these games utilize all the functions of the pro/joycon controllers. They utilize the thumb stick buttons to replace certain things which is also quite weird when going from playing these games on their original console, to this emulator.<br /><br />By far and away my biggest problem is with sunshine. I was a biiiig sunshine fan when I was growing up and I still have 2 copies of it for my gamecube. I guess I never really realized that the controls for sunshine were inverted, I just got used to it and now whenever I play it my mind automatically goes back into ""sunshine mode"" and I play fine with the inversion. I understand that most people are not used to this so making them default to non-inverted controls makes sense, but why not make in an option? They obviously messed with the bindings already to un-invert the controls so why not just make it toggleable? This makes sunshine pretty unplayable. I'm pretty hesitant to start playing it now cause I don't want to get super used to the non-inverted controls and then be terrible at the original version. Another huge issue is the non-existence of gamecube controller support. Nintendo already makes gamecube controllers and adapters for the switch, so why not let mario sunshine work with a gamecube controller? Again, they went through the effort to remap buttons so why not keep the mode compatible with gamecube? One more thing that is really weird is that the B button is now mapped to jump, so the muscle memory of hitting A->B to jump and dive (which is a very used movement mechanic in this game) is gone. That and the over-the-shoulder cam is now bound to right stick click which is really foreign.<br /><br />If you haven't played any of the original games, and this is the first time you are getting introduced to them, this is a great deal. However, if you have played them before, or are even huge fans, expect some disappointment and weird button mappings until you get used to them.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AGUXLNPQNYFQYDFY2ZDG4X3VYT6Q,2020-09-20 21:22:45.906,1,False
4.0,A Decent anniversary celebration with minor tweaks.,"If you don't own these on any other platform this is a great way to revisit these beloved classics. Mario 64 is almost tripled it's original resolution while holding a stable 30 frames per second with this being a port of the revised ""Shindou pak taiou"" 1997 edition the backwards vault slide glitch was fixed along with the ""So long gay bowser"" meme but most textures are unchanged. Super Mario Sunshine seems to have had the most attention with more vibrant colors all around as well as the higher resolution resulting in a much less blurry image. However this game also runs at 30 frames per second and the classic GameCube controls have been slightly altered due to differences when compared with the Switch's Joycons, even when using an adapter (so you can no longer change the water pressure.) Last but not least Mario Galaxy looks sharper than ever with the boost in resolution and transitions to modern displays quite smoothly, motion controls are integrated very well and this is an all around smooth 60fps experience. The soundtrack from all 3 games are also included.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XsTVj2-HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XsTVj2-HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XsTVj2-HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AEFFW2N2FHXUFQUQLTJRRCWJNPQQ,2020-09-18 16:40:47.593,57,True

4.0,A great selection of games in a mediocre collection,"Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy are all fantastic games and this is their best official release they've ever had. Sunshine and Galaxy both benefit immensely from the bump up to HD, and Sunshine in particular benefits especially from the addition of widescreen. Mario 64, on the other hand, has not had many improvements made. Unlike Sunshine, 64 is still in 4:3 aspect ratio, not widescreen, and its frame rate has seen no improvements. There are much better unofficial ways to play Mario 64 these days and unfortunately Nintendo's own version falls wildly short of those. All three games are great nonetheless, and as far as official releases go, there are no other options that are better than this.<br /><br />The collection itself, however, is almost comically barebones. For a collection featuring three of Nintendo's biggest games they've ever made, I truly would've expected some more love and care to be placed in its bonus features. It offers no behind the scenes information, no concept art, no looks into cut content, no additional modes or quality of life improvements for the games included, nothing like any of that.  It offers a *single* bonus feature, and that's the ability to listen to the official soundtrack releases of the three included games. It falls short of other, less expensive collections out there today, such as the Megaman Legacy collections, the Disney Afternoon Collection, or even Nintendo's *own* Kirby's Dream Collection from eight years ago, which all feature loads of interesting and valuable side content to enjoy other than just the games themselves.<br /><br />The games themselves, to me, are worth the price of admission- but for a full $60 retail game, released to celebrate the anniversary of the most famous video game character in the world, I would've expected Nintendo to put a lot more effort into making this package seem truly special.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AEXU2QU2XSZTL42TWCGXTO4XQQHA,2020-09-26 18:53:24.995,1,True

Wow so great, I’m glad I can listen to music from my switch instead of using my iPhone.<br /><br />Did they fix the awful camera in Super Mario 64? Nope in fact using the thumb stick to move the camera is more awkward because they keep the old c buttons so you gotta move the thumb stick one way and then take your finger off the stick and then move the stick again.<br /><br />Not to mention the pointer gets lost all the time in Mario galaxy (something the wii version didn’t have much of an issue with).<br /><br />The good thing about the games is that they look good on a modern television but did they actually update the graphics so the games look like Mario odyssey? Or even Mario galaxy? Nope super Mario 64 still looks blocky.<br /><br />So all in all don’t spend your money on this game.

I'm very happy with this purchase and with Skyrim for Switch too. I really want to get a dockable Switch (the version 2) but everywhere I look the prices are ridiculously high which sucks. But eventually, when I can find one at the correct price of 299.99, I'm definitely getting one. Until then though, I'm happy with my Lite and my games for it.

5.0,"Great games, lazy and greedy Nintendo","Whether Mario All Stars 3D is worth it will differ among people. Objectively, it isn't. It's $60 for a fairly barebones emulation of 3 very old games. For $40 you can get full on remakes like Crash Trilogy, Spyro, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Destroy All Humans!, and Mafia Definitive Edition. Nintendo knows a collection of some of their best Mario games would sell, so they did the least amount of effort for maximum profit and even made it a limited time offer to salt the wound even further.<br /><br />Why did I review it 5 stars? Mario Galaxy is not a complete emulation. It runs natively on the Switch’s cpu. This means 60 FPS smooth buttery goodness with graphics and gameplay that hold up extremely well in 2020. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and for me I know I will get $60 of enjoyment out of having it on my switch alongside Sunshine and 64.

4.0,"Great to have these games portably, bare-bones package.","This is hard to rate.<br /><br />If you've never played these games... I don't know if I'd recommend this for $60, but you will likely never have a chance to purchase it for less.<br /><br />Super Mario 64 is a landmark 3D platformer, but it shows its age. The controls and the camera do not place nice together, especially in cramped spaces. Most of my deaths have come from sudden camera shifts, or Mario walking off a ledge because he'll sometimes move in a semi-circle when he turns around.<br /><br />The level design is incredible, the sound design is some of the most satisfying of any of the Mario series, the game oozes creativity, but if you didn't grow up with early 3D platformers it's hard to recommend. I would heavily encourage anyone to give it a try, but not for $60, and not even as part of a $60 package. A Hat in Time and Spyro Reignited much easier to recommend than Mario 64.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine is really charming, but it's bland next to Mario 64. It's another game that I'd heartily recommend giving a try, but not for $60. Everyone's mileage varies with this game. The camera is pretty unruly. It has some glitchy segments that haven't been fixed in this edition.<br /><br />For my personal experience, I've done a 120 star run of Mario 64, and I'm about to finish another one on this collection. That can be tedious at points, but it's satisfying enough for me to stick with it. I will probably never get all the shine sprites. Some missions are just that frustrating to me. I like Sunshine, but I don't love it.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy is easily the best game on here, and while I know some of the other reviews complained about it still using motion controls, this version at least has the spin move - your main attack - mapped to a button.<br /><br />I liked Galaxy back on the Wii, but I was so allergic to motion controls that even though it was obviously a great game I never got very far. Playing it with a pro controller takes some getting used to because you have to shift the whole controller when you need to move the pointer on the screen, but it doesn't take long before it feels fairly natural, and being able to do the spin without the waggle has increased my enjoyment of the game immensely.<br /><br />This is, bar none, the best these games have ever looked in a retail release. These are the definitive versions of all three games on console.<br /><br />By others means... Is a different matter.<br /><br />There's ways to play Mario 64 at 60fps, 1080p widescreen, with mods that drastically improve the camera. That Nintendo gave us Mario 64 at 30fps in 720p with some improved textures is disappointing, to say the least. The source code is out in the wild. Fans have made fantastic remasters that run on Switch hardware. If you're a first-timer, I would recommend those ports in a heartbeat over this. If you already own a copy of Mario 64 on original hardware or on the Wii, I don't see any reason to pick up 3D All Stars for this.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine runs about as well as it does on the Dolphin emulator. On the one hand, I'm really glad they put the effort in and that we can play Sunshine on a modern platform. On the other, it feels so low-effort.<br /><br />Galaxy probably had the fewest changes, but it needed the least amount of work. It's honestly a masterpiece. If you're a newcomer, it justifies the price tag all on its own. At 1080p, it looks like it was made for current hardware and plays like a dream on the Switch.<br /><br />If you love Mario, get this. It's a collector's item. Even if you never intend to play it, it's a piece of history. If you loved the games when you were a kid and don't own them anymore, these are the versions to get. If you played them to death or own other versions, nothing here is worth rushing to the store to get it. If you're still on the fence, don't bother.<br /><br />The only extras in this are the soundtracks for each game. It's nice to have, but I'm never going to play them on my Switch. I would've rather gotten codes for Spotify or Amazon.<br /><br />The lack of an in-game art gallery, unlockable commercials, concept sketches, etc. is extremely disappointing. As far as I'm concerned, Sonic Mega Collection back on the Gamecube set the gold standard for retro game collections, and this is nowhere close to being on the same level.<br /><br />The omission of Galaxy 2 and 3D Land also bother me. If one or both of those games were included, this would be an absolute no-brainer.<br /><br />Mario is popular enough I think you already know whether this is for you.",[],B08G3MN6KP,B08JHZHWZ3,AGO4W67CD52DONRG4GLEZCVLIPKQ,2020-09-21 02:22:01.054,16,True
