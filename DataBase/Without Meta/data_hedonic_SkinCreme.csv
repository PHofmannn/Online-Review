5.0,Give it a try! I'm really glad I did!,"I use this to set and refresh my make up. I've never used a setting product before but this was recommend in another review so I thought I'd try it. I was somewhat skeptical since the ingredients all seem so..... NORMAL in this day and age of every product needing some fancy new buzzword exotic ingredient or new innovative chemical.... I figured I'd try it but didn't expect much since most of the aforementioned wowee-zowy miracle buzzword products (which this isn't) give me underwhelming results. But I've been really surprised what a difference this product makes! And the smell is really nice.<br /><br />I have break-out prone skin and I've had no breakouts since using this product and if anything my skins been much easier to deal with. I don't know if that has anything to do with using this or not, but at the very least I can say it's definitely not breaking me out or anything. But because of my skin I usually have to put my foundation on thick and also try to camouflage some decent-sized areas of my face since my breakouts tend to cluster. Anyone in the same boat knows that it's really hard to do without creating a patchy uneven look and a heavy coating that looks nothing like tge texture of skin. I feel like this spray does a great job of adding a more natural finish to my makeup as well as smoothing out/blending in/hiding the areas which before definitely looked like I was trying to hide something. I'll definitely keep using this product. Plus it's nice to find something effective that's going to last a long time and which I don't have to save up for to afford.",[],B002LC9OES,B0C5WPD2RN,AGXGWJ3VEAQNTVEIVQH6LMOJWF2Q,2017-07-12 23:44:56.942,1,True
1.0,Luxury Beauty? Meh.. Has added PERFUME and ARTIFICIAL COLORS dyes,"Just.. ok. Barely<br /><br />Pro: Two in a pack- yay! Spray bottles are easier than dabbing with cotton ball. I keep one bottle with my face care and one in my purse. I spritz as a toner, I spritz to freshen up my face and sometimes even my hair.  Works in a pinch to freshen up the air. I don't really notice any benefit. Nor do I notice anything bad in terms of effectiveness.  In that, I am truly neutral (3 stars)<br /><br />CON: The added coloring is totally unnecessary, as is the added fragrance. WHY do that? The latter isn't obnoxious, but it could do without. (1 star). Questionable ingredients. I usually run ingredients through EWG (environmental working group) to see how it rates, but I failed to do so before deciding on this purchase. Shame on me.<br /><br />Stay away if you have sensitive skin, scent nausea, or conditions like Rosacea where anything can trigger a flare up.<br /><br />Clean up the ingredients, take out the fake coloring and perfume. This will be my only purchase of this brand when there are better out there.<br /><br />In the mean time, buy your own ingredients and make your own hydrating toner/refresher.",[],B074Z2HFBW,B0C5WPD2RN,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,2018-05-14 18:08:23.553,0,False

It smells just like fresh roses. It is not oily or greasy, yet my skin drinks it in and has become softer, less irritated and the peeling and flakiness have completely subsided. My breakouts are reduced by half and are no longer painful and red. My skin is really starting to normalize and it's only been a day and a half! Everything I've used on my skin lately has stung except for this spray.

It leaves your skin plump, moisturized and comfortable.<br /><br />I can't wait to continue using this spray and see what effects it continues to have on my skin and how it works with makeup.

5.0,I use this spray multiple times a day! Love it!,"For my skin care routine, I first start with the shea moisture African black soap system. After cleansing my face with that, I put 2 drops of jojoba oil, and 2 drops of rosehip seed oil in my wet palm..rub my hands together and massage into my face and neck. I follow that with the moisturizer for problem skin that came in the shea moisture African black soap kit, and finish with a few sprays of this. The combination of all of this has my combination, acne prone, sensitive, dry skin, looking the best it has looked since I was a child!! I don't use this as a setting spray because the spray that is on the bottle is too strong and causes my make up to look blotchy..but on days I'm not wearing any make up, I use this throughout the day to refresh my face. It feels amazing during a hot summer day while I am laying out! Best rose water spray out there! I have also used this on my 2 son's sunburn, and they both said that it made it not hurt anymore. The sun burn did not peel like it usually does, and it was less red when they woke up in the morning.

It leaves my skin slightly tacky (which is typical of most facial sprays), and I prefer this product over Mac Fix+, not only because it's more affordable, but because it feels lighter on my skin.

5.0,Best facial spray ever!,"My skin loves this stuff! I bought this because a Youtuber recommended this, and of course I had to try it because I'm one of those girls. Anyways..<br /><br />It's super hydrating and makes my face feel soft and refreshed at any time of the day when I use it. It's even nice over makeup as a setting spray. It's pretty much the easiest skin care step ever, you just spray it all over your face (3-4 squirts) and you're done. I use this at night, in the morning, in the middle of the day, before makeup, ect. It's just amazing. I keep it beside my sink in my bathroom with my other skincare products so whenever I go in there I can just squirt it all over my face and boom. Amazing.<br /><br />It has a soft rose scent that's not too overpowering, which is nice for people who are sensitive to strong perfumes. This small bottle has lasted me about 3 months now and I've recently started using it more and more so it looks like I'll be needing more soon. And at $7 you can't beat the price.<br /><br />Also, one of the reasons I truly love this stuff is because it doesn't irritate my skin at all.

We like to try out the next new thing & usually forget about things that we've tried that have been good but not amazing.  This product is unforgettable.  We have purchased it several times because it is a permanent part of our skincare routine.  We even purchase this as gifts, because it's something many people might not buy for themselves.  Everyone loves this.  It's universally appropriate for all skin types.  We use it as a toner, makeup setting spray, to refresh our makeup as needed, & just to lift our mood when we're feeling blah.  You won't know how you ever lived w/out it after you try it.  :-)",[],B074ZD7KZX,B0C5WPD2RN,AHL7BQDEKVUJPDLRA5CS642QIDZQ,2018-03-05 19:57:34.694,1,True

Applied directly after my makeup application, it seems to give my face polish, a more finished look. I use 1-2 spritzes at a time so it seems like it will last forever.

4.0,Trying a new Rose Water,"When this arrived each bottle was individually wrapped in a plastic zip locked baggie.<br />(If the temp was any hotter the day it arrived or it if it a longer ship time -I believe this would have leaked in the baggies, in my opinion. I prefer each spray top to be tapped along with the individually wrapped in a plastic zip locked baggie tapped at the top as well. Other Amazon sellers package products similar to this one like this already.) Sometime Amazon packages multiple items in the same box and mine came with an other item that could have been damaged if these bottles leaked.)<br />I tested each bottle to check if these were the ""actual"" products sent. Each smelled, so far wonderful and subtle (the sent didn't last too long)  I could smell what was listed to be in the product. There wasn't anything on the plastic bottle to inform me if it was recyclable or what type of plastic it was. This is a concern since my previous go-to rose water(That I've been buying for over 3 years) the plastic bottle it comes in and how the product is delivered onto your skin every time you use it -I just found out, it's made from a harmful plastic(?)<br />Since this Rose Water has a better ""rating"" and a ""Amazon's Buyer Choice/Recommended"" I decided to try this enhanced ""Rose Water""<br />I noticed that the reviews are varied depending on person and what ""bottle"" of product they received (which is scary! Is there someone handling quality control or monitoring these possible third party sellers? I hope Amazon is helping buyers of these possible dupes who've suffered from skin problems) and I'm going to watch my skin very closely since I do have sensitive skin and feel/look of my skin and smell is VERY important to me.<br />I will update this review after awhile of use.",[],B00172O9NO,B0C5WPD2RN,AENUOZYYJY4EBGYDYOPGAVBSCMHA,2020-06-16 18:58:42.055,1,True

5.0,My K-Beauty Routine,"At 32 I had stubborn hormonal acne and dry flaky skin (thanks in part to the dry climate in Colorado) I was tired of constantly fighting my skin and embarked on a journey to get the clear youthful skin I deserved. I was pleased to find that the skin of my dreams in a Korean beauty inspired routine. The best part is that nearly all the products I tried were relatively inexpensive and readily available from amazon. My acne is non-existent now and the tone and texture of my skin is so supple and smooth. I have provided a list of my routine below which includes  this product. I’m not saying this is the best or only way to achieve my results, I just thought others would be interested in what I used.<br /><br />*indicates review for this product<br /><br />AM- hydrating, lightweight, works under makeup<br /><br />Cleanser - [[ASIN:B00BN7PVXK BOOTS Botanics All Bright Gentle Cleansing Cream]] (purchased from Ulta for a fraction of the price $6.99)<br /><br />*First Toner- [[ASIN:B002LC9OES Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater, 4 oz.]]– $7.00 - This is like a drink of water for your face. I love this stuff and will spray again randomly throughout the day whenever I need a refresher. The aroma is a little strong for my liking but (almost like perfume) but I’m willing to overlook since the rose and aloe does so much for my skin. I used to use just straight rose water which has a very present smell but I like the spray delivery of this product better.<br /><br />Moisturizing Toner-[[ASIN:B00PBJSOWQ [Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml]] –$12.98 -  I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost. This toner works well to moisturize and calm my skin and will certainly be re-purchasing. A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!<br /><br />Treatment- [[ASIN:B00NQHFGMG Body Merry Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Anti-aging with Vitamic C and Natural Green Tea, 2 Oz]]– $13.99 - I use this during the day to keep my skin feeling hydrated and give my skin the boost of anti-oxidants to help combat ageing. This is a lightweight serum (which is why I use it under my makeup) but it does take some time to fully absorb in and dry on my skin. After I put this on I generally go and have breakfast before coming back to finish. The aroma leans more towards green tea which again I find refreshing for the morning. The syrup is a milky and slightly viscous with minimal stickiness.<br /><br />Eye Cream- [[ASIN:B00C9EKOHY Loreal Revitalift Eye Cream 0.5 Ounce (14ml)]] (14ml) – (Purchased  from Ulta)<br /><br />Face Cream- [[ASIN:B00NTR9B6A [MIZON] Snail Recovery Gel Cream 45ml (1.52 fl.oz.) Pack of 2]]– $9.99/ 2-pack  - Lightweight moisturizer which works perfectly under makeup. This product doesn’t’ have much of a smell. The consistency is unique halfway between a gel and a cream. Glides on smoothly and provides a decent amount of hydration when combines with my other hydrating products. I don’t like to use occlusive products during the day and this moisturizer fits the bill.<br /><br />PM-all about Snail- Repair, Hydrated, Moisturize<br /><br />Makeup Remover- [[ASIN:B00G0JN5FM Boots Botanics All Bright Soothing Eye Make-up Remover 5 oz.]] – Purchased at Ulta for a fraction of the price - $6.99<br /><br />Double Cleanse -[[ASIN:B00SUZWGHM [Total 2Pcs] The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil + Foam SET]] –$14.21 -  The oil cleanser feels light and silky. At night, I massage 1 pump into my skin and works well to dissolve the days make-up. Once I am done breaking down all the makeup, I use water to get some of it off before moving to the foam cleanser. My only complaint is that the fragrance is a little strong and can burn my eyes if I’m not careful. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. The foam cleanser works well to clean off the oil left on my face. The foam cleanser aroma is a lot more tolerable to me. It comes out of the tube a shimmery white color and is Very gentle. These two cleansers work well to get my face clean and ready for treatments without that typical tight feeling. They leave my skin soft and moisturized.<br /><br />Exfoliation -  [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion & Peel System Microdermabrasion Treatment 1 Kit]] - $21.99 - one a week - I used to use philosophy's microderm kit but this one offers the same exact results for 1/2 of the price. This exfoliator leaves my skin feeling baby soft but it does seem a tad harsh so I don't like to use it too frequently. I love the fresh citrus smell of the crystals and the warming foaming action once you put on the activator. Since I only use this once a week it lasts for a VERY long time and is totally worth the price.<br /><br />Toner- [[ASIN:B00PBJSOWQ [Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml]] –$12.98  I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost.

A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!<br /><br />Essence - [[ASIN:B00PBX3L7K [Cosrx] Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence 100ml]] – $15.85 - I only use this at night because it does leave bit of a film on my face which I find unpleasant under make up. It dries quickly and a single pump gives me enough to cover my whole face and neck. There is no smell to speak of but it does have a slimy snail-y texture ( it is 96% slime!) and can be a bit tacky once its all said and done.  I have also used this on some iron burns to help it heal faster and minimize scaring with a lot of success.<br /><br />Treatment-[[ASIN:B00B73SMFY MIZON Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule - Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula]] - $11.43 -  Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula- Clear viscous liquid. Not nearly as slimy as the essence. No smell, absorbs quickly. I focus heavily on the snail products at night because I read that the copper peptides naturally contained in the snail can<br />alter the effectiveness of the vitamin C and vice versa.<br /><br />Spot Treatment-[[ASIN:B00AFNYMFG [MIZON] Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot 30ml]]– $14.95 - Use only as needed – Works wonders to diminish blemishes overnight. I used this quite frequently when I first started but after a while using all these products I didn’t have any acne to speak of!<br /><br />Sheet Mask - [[ASIN:B00BAM7F8C Dermal Korea Collagen Essence Full Face Facial Mask Sheet, 16 Combo Pack]] – $10.40 - I use once a week. I know that sheet masks are the totally hot thing in Korean beauty but I don’t think they do much for me other than a relaxing home spa experience. I just don’t see that they provide much and probably  will not be buying more.<br /><br />Eye Cream- [[ASIN:B00AFLSE7U MIZON Korean Cosmetics Snail Repair Eye Cream, 1 Ounce]] 1 Ounce – $13.98 -  Light weight, absorbs quickly. The container is quite generous and a little will go a long way. I think I will have this for a while! It doesn’t have any smell.<br /><br />Face Cream- [[ASIN:B00B4PWEJU MIZON Black Snail All In One Cream, 2.40 Ounce]] –$10.49 -  Like all of the Mizon Snail products I have tried this is a very easy introduction into the world of snail skin care. It has minimum smell and lightweight texture. Minimal slime factor, you wouldn’t even know it was snail in a blind comparison.  It has a off white color and a lightweight consistency. It doesn’t work wall as an occlusive if that’s what you want you may need to add a different moisturizer at night.<br /><br />Face Oils- I use a mixture of two oils applied at once: [[ASIN:B00LNOV8JO Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil 4 oz - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic]]. - $13.95 -  and [[ASIN:B01GUEVP7G Radha Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil for Hair, Face & Skin 4 oz - USDA Organic 100% Pure Cold pressed Virgin Oil From Morocco - By Radha Beauty]] –$12.95 -  I like to use the oils last because I feel like it really seals everything in and provides moisture to last me through the night.

I also put it on at night before going to bed I put it on and let it dry before using my nighttime moisturizer.  It does not feel greasy at all.  It's very light and refreshing -it has a pleasant rose  sent so if you don't like the smell of roses this is not the product for you.

4.0,Completely changed my skincare routine...,"Hate the fact is has dyes but LOVE the fact is has literally replaced my entire skin care routine -- I used to have uncontrollable combination skin.  Half of my face felt like the Sahara and the other half was a pit stop at the Daytona 500, no matter whether I was wearing make up or not.  Most beauty items I had tried failed on me or made me breakout with in a day.  A friend suggested I may have sensitive skin, and that this brand may work.  She raved about the pimple reducer, which we joked about reminded us of calamine from when we were children. She went on to tell me about how their products are great but can be hit or miss.  So I took a risk, well, if you call $7.00 a risk.<br /><br />And what a great risk that was.<br /><br />Now my daily skincare routine takes me five minutes, tops.  At the bathroom sink I exfoliate oil and blackhead prone areas (without water!) Garnier Charcoal, sweep my face with a soaking konjac sponge (depending on the time of day I'll use a different color), then liberally spray this. All over my face.  In two ample circles.  And in a downwards angle.  I do this entire routine two to four times a day.  After two days my blackheads were gone.  After a week, my skin looked like porcelain.<br /><br />Needless to say, this new routine has made a marked difference in my skin -- and how I feel in the skin I'm in.  I simpay cannot get over how well it has worked!!  My face feels like fine paper to the touch, and I am obsessed with how it smells.  I even use it in my hair as suggested.<br /><br />It works well, smells amazing, has mostly great benefits ... but the ingredients..... please find better colorants.

5.0,Great for calming skin,"I have tried at least 6 other facial sprays from witch hazel to thermal spring water and I believe the Mario Badescu facial spray is the best. I have tried other rosewater sprays, but found they do not help with the redness and calming of my skin as much as this one does. I think it is due to the aloe and other extra herbs in this product that separates it from the rest of the facial sprays. I wash my face with a foaming cleanser to prevent irritating any breakouts I have and then apply my Thayer's Witch Hazel Toner (Alcohol Free Toner so my skin isn't stripped of moisture). After using toner I then moisturize and use this facial spray. Sometimes I use the facial spray before and after I moisturize. For the price I think there is a great amount of product and the mist is fine and doesn't squirt and attack your face with a lot of product. I carry the travel size container in my purse and mist my face throughout the day for a little pick me up. Do I think this product has completely transformed my skin?

Ethanol makes products quickly dry which makes them feel weightless on the skin for cheap...

2.0,Has red 33 in it and BLUE 1?!,"Upon receiving this product, I immediately regretted not reading all of the ingredients previous to purchasing it. While red 33 is common in cosmetics and is FDA approved, it is still derived from petroleum and coal. Because of this, I consider it to be unsafe for human consumption, even on the skin. And, the fact that it contains BLUE 1 is baffling to me, considering the fact that it is the least recommended dye to put on skin because it causes the most irritation. BLUE 1 is also known to cause nerve damage and asthma, among other health problems. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this for a part of anybody skin routine.

I try to look for natural products the best I can, but not to the point where I'm like a hippie or anything so please don't throw rocks at me if my products aren't straight from the earth. :(<br /><br />I moisturize every night with a homemade whipped shea butter and almond oil lotion. It's very moisturizing but obviously not for the daytime because it's on the heavier side (I like my face to feel like it's getting a treatment overnight!).<br /><br />During the day, I use Cetaphil's face lotion with SPF. It's moisturizing, but of course it's not going to be like a night cream! So if you ever need a pick me up... MARIO BADEACU ROSEWATER SPRAY TO THE RESCUE! It has aloe in it and smells like roses. I just give my face a spritz and I instantly feel my skin perk up. It's not greasy, just moisturizing. I've gotten so many of my friends and family obsessed with this stuff. I have a bottle on my bathroom counter and one in my purse for on the go. I've even used it to spray on my hair if I'm out in public and my hair is a frizzy mess!<br /><br />Don't believe the hype?

I use extensions and I spray them with a little bit of this before I brush them out and they remain so soft and shiny, as does my natural hair.<br /><br />I just reordered the product in the 8 oz container, the combination of aloe, rosewater, and herbs is probably my favorite thing right now in terms of beauty. Other rosewater sprays don't offer this combination of ingredients.<br /><br />I would not recommend using it to set makeup - the way it disperses from the pump is much thicker and not as uniform as the fine mist you would require for even coverage.

5.0,Gentle spray for sensitive combo/acne prone skin,"Age: mid-twenties<br />My skin type: combination/acne prone<br />I purchased this spray about a month ago and have been using it twice daily. I will spritz it on my face several times after showering and massage it gently into my skin. I give it a couple of minutes to sink in before adding my moisturizer on top (Mario Badescu Seaweed Night Cream- also a loved product!). I also use it in the morning, but only with 1-2 sprays. I'll have to admit, I was a skeptic when purchasing this product, but I knew I would be traveling a lot and I was concerned about the effects of airplane air, as well as exposing my skin to frequent changes in weather. Since using this spray, I've noticed that my skin tone is much more even, my skin feels smoother and more supple, and what really surprised me is that my breakouts have reduced in frequency and severity. I've used about a third of the bottle in the time that I've had it (~1 month). I also appreciate that the scent doesn't linger and that it doesn't bother my sensitive eyes, however, it does have a bitter taste if you happen to get some on your lips.

5.0,"Trust me, you NEED this!!",This facial spray is straight up amazing!! I first heard about this product from a lot of the youtubers (Jaclyn Hill) I follow that have a makeup channel. I also have recently seen many celebrity makeup artists (for Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian in particular) use this product and I have to agree its a must have!! Its all natural so if your into organic things this is perfect for you. It can be used on bare skin for hydration or after doing a full face of makeup as a setting spray to make your makeup last all day. If your using it for makeup purposes its amazing and really does help your makeup last all day BUT it also takes the powder texture away from the skin and bring that glowy look back to your face. Its incredible. I also use it on my bare skin in the mornings and night to hydrate my skin and make it look more plump and I've legit noticed a difference I'm not even kidding.

I use it as a toner, a makeup setting spray, and just to refresh my skin throughout the day. The aloe in the formula is great for calming and soothing any irritation or redness on the skin, and it works well on all skin types.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the Rosewater Facial Spray with Aloe to anyone looking for a lightweight, hydrating, and refreshing skincare product.

Wasn't sure what the heck was happening, then I stopped using the spray and my skin stopped acting up and went back to its normal self...it was strange.

It is light enough that women with oily skin don't have to worry about it clogging your pores. It can be used to set makeup, but I don't wear makeup so I can't comment on that. It also smells amazing and tastes good on your skin (like roses). I usually have a couple of sprays and I am good. It has lasted a while for me and I use it daily.

5.0,Worth every penny,"For those who are new to Facial mists<br /><br />1. A huge craze going back in Asia to keep skin hydrated, women use this mid day to retain the moisture on skin<br />2. You could use it mid day like fellow Asians, use it before Make up as setting base, after make, or during long flights, especially if you don't want to use that flight water on face yuck !!<br />3. If you are thinking that it looks like water and will melt down your make up you can't be more wrong. The consistency is heavier than water possibly due to Aloe in  it and as soon as you spray it will feel like rain drops on your face give it few minutes and your face will dry leaving you feeling fresh. Some people suggest dabbing it with your fingertips, I don't unless you've washed your hands and don't have any make up, dabbing will mess your make up<br />4. If you guys are thinking about the cost then let me tell you, for any facial mist the cost will depend on ingredients, the more natural they are the expensive the product. The higher end facial mists have Green tea, snail secretion and other stuff. This one is just not bad with aloe and rosewater<br />5.

While I didn’t mind it, it was a little tacky (in feeling) and I noticed after prolong use my face was drying out in patches like never before - I have not ever had dry skin or patches!

It smells really nice and it feels refreshing. I really love the smell of rosewater. I also spray it on throughout the day. When I feel tired or my skin feels heavy, I spray it on, and it helps. I bought a smaller travel spray bottle and filled it with this to carry it around with me in my backpack. I totally recommend it. It's quite natural.

1.0,risky chemicals in this product!,"I tried this product because of all the recent hype. THIS PRODUCT MADE ME BREAK OUT IN HIVES, especially around my eyes. My skin is extremely dry now and burns to the touch. On top of that, it made my makeup very cakey, my skin look wrinkley, and my face feel tight and dehydrated.<br /><br />The SECOND ingredient is propylene glycol, a small organic alcohol commonly used as a skin conditioning agent. This ingredient is a skin irritant and known to cause allergic contact dermatitis as well as contact urticaria (rash) in humans; these sensitization effects can be manifested at propylene glycol concentrations as low as 2%. Since this is the second ingredient, the concentration is likely more than 2% and probably why it did such significant damage to my skin. Be very cautious when using this product!!!<br /><br />Lastly, the fragrance and dye are skin irritants and I'm just really disappointed in this product. Having sensitive skin sucks and I had high hopes for this product.

Because I don't want this smell on me I find myself never wearing it. For a cheaper alternative I've been going with the Elf spray.

5.0,I'm Hooked,"I have dry skin, especially during the winter. I came across this product almost three years ago and have used it ever since. I keep a bottle at home and work, and another travel size in my purse. I spritz my face 5-6 times a day, maybe more. First time is in the morning after I wash my face and before I slap on moisturizer. I spray my face and let it dry before adding light make-up, and spritz again to set the make up once I'm dolled up. I am married, but for you single women trying to find your soul mate, here's a helpful hint. People search for kissable partners and women wearing noticiable make-up is a huge turn off. Taste your foundation or face powder to understand why. It is unpleasant, and transfers to the taste buds while kissing. Instead of packing on more make-up, I freshen my face 2-3 times during the day with a few squirts of this product. It does not remove the make-up I applied hours before, and once this product dries and absorbs into my pours, it does not leave a yucky, perfuming residue. After a heavy workout or coming in from a terribly hot day, just a couple of pumps of this product over my face and drinking water is all I need to cool down fast. I get monthly facials and my Esthetician sense my dry skin, however, she commented on how well I keep my face hydrated and wanted to know the product I use. I text her a picture of this product and she's been recommending it to her clients since. Having terribly dry skin ages a woman fast. With lack of moisture, too much sun exposure and wearing heavy make up can make women my age look ten years older, even moreso with bad eating and sleeping habits, lack of water intake and smoking. Although, genetics contributes to my youthful appearance, maintaining proper care of my body and skin keeps me looking years younger than I actually am.

I actually feel like my face is dryer using MB, so I tend to use more.<br />- Makeup Setting Spray: MB sets my makeup fine. Thayer's seems to set my makeup with more moisture.<br />- Facial Mist: Both work fine for touch up misting throughout the day when my face either feels oily or dry. Prefer Thayer's for moisture, but feel MB is nice when I want a lighter mist.<br />- Hair Mist: My hair is too coarse and wavy that I don't see a difference using either as a hair mist.<br /><br />APPLICATION<br />- Mario Badescu: The spray pump is okay. I would prefer to transfer it into a nicer spray bottle.<br />- Thayer's: Comes in a squeeze bottle that's easy to transfer to any spray bottle, but the bottle can leak if you have the older version.<br /><br />PACKAGE<br />- Mario Badescu: Comes in a frosted plastic bottle with a plastic spray with a paper label. Comes in a smaller, portable size too.<br />- Thayer's: Comes in a glossy bottle with a plastic lid. Not very portable. Usually you transfer the rosewater to a different bottle.<br />- Side Note: I prefer using glass bottles with metal sprays, so that's where I find MB's spray bottle unnecessary.<br /><br />PRICE<br />- Mario Badescu: $12 for 8oz ($1.50/oz)<br />- Thayer's: $10 for 12oz ($0.83/oz)<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would go with Thayer's, especially if you have really dry skin like me.

I use it before applying makeup and I also use just a tiny bit after I apply all my makeup, just after I allow my setting spray to dry.  Some use it as a setting spray itself but seeing as it's quite moisturizing,  I have left myself looking too oily for my liking when I have on a full face of makeup.  So just 1 spray after everything else is all i need if I'm using it with my makeup that day.<br />I have also used it in the length of my hair to make it smooth.<br />I absolutely love the smell!!!<br />I reccomend it to literally everyone!

1.0,I was extremely disappointed to find that this product has propylene glycol in ...,"I was extremely disappointed to find that this product has propylene glycol in it. I found this article online about it on THEGOODHUMAN&#62;COM.:<br /><br /> &#34;What is propylene glycol? It is is a chemical found in personal care products that acts as a penetration enhancer that keeps products from melting in heat and/or freezing when it is cold. It is found in items such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, acne treatment, moisturizer, toothpaste, deodorant, nail polish, mascara; basically anything you could possibly use on your body, propylene glycol is in it. But why should you avoid propylene glycol?<br /><br />For starters it alters the structure of the skin by allowing chemicals to penetrate deep beneath it while increasing their ability to reach the blood stream. Sounds lovely, right? So even if propylene glycol was good for you, it’s main job is to help any other chemicals you come in contact with reach your bloodstream. Who wants to use a chemical designed to help other chemicals penetrate even deeper into your skin? Not me.<br /><br />However, there is even more to it than just that…<br />How Toxic is Propylene Glycol<br /><br />According to the Environmental Working Group, propylene glycol can cause a whole host of problems. It is rated a 3 by them, which is categorized as a “moderate” health issue. It has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental/reproductive issues, allergies/immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and organ system toxicity. It has been found to provoke skin irritation and sensitization in humans as low as 2% concentration, while the industry review panel recommends cosmetics can contain up to 50% of the substance. It has also been classified as “expected to be toxic or harmful” by Environment Canada.<br />How to Spot Propylene Glycol<br /><br />When looking at ingredient lists, you can look for names like 1,2-Dihydroxypropane; 2-Hydroxypropanol; Methylethy Glycol; 1,2-Propanediol; Propane-1,2-Diol. Some popular products that contain propylene glycol include:<br /><br />  Biolage by Matrix Conditioning Balm<br />  Nivea for Men Hair & Body Wash, Sensitive<br />  Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Overnight Cream<br />  Arm & Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant, Unscented<br />  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer For All Skin Types<br /><br />So take a look at the ingredients of the products that you use and search for propylene glycol or the other names it is often called/listed as. I try my best to only use safe, natural products, but I am always reading labels in the store before I purchase anything. Chances are there is a safe alternative to a toxic favorite. Next time you are shopping for a personal care item, be sure to remember what propylene glycol is and do your best to avoid it!&#34;",[],B002LC9OES,B0C5WPD2RN,AGX55Z3RWMN4ZU5LYN64AUOWDWLQ,2014-11-04 01:06:55.000,31,True

But besides just the spray, the box contained a bunch of generously sized samples including hand cream, facial moisturizer, and body wash. I am in LOVE with the hand cream and will be purchasing a full sized bottle.<br /><br />The spray has such a light and refreshing scent, if you like the smell of roses you will not be disappointed. According to the bottle it can be used on your face, neck, and hair, and to set your make up. Now, as far as setting your make up goes, it definitely works as long as you don't spray too heavily. In fact, if you over do it with the spray, your make up is going to run right off. I used two light spritzes and my make up lasted all day and night.

5.0,You might think you don’t need this. You do.,"I am not a hippie dippy “omgz it has CHEMICALZZZ” kind of person because, well - everything is chemicals. Sooo anyway... to me, this rose water spray is amazing. I was skeptical about what I thought was overpriced perfumed water but this stuff is legit. I buy a ton of skincare stuff and am not easily sold on the claimed benefits. While this is not some holy grail catch-all fix for problematic skin... it is very refreshing and in my experience has helped keep my skin at bay. Sometimes (okay maybe most days!) I’m too lazy and tired to do my full routine so I know that this has helped to keep my acne prone, oily skin at bay because I usually always incorporate it. It also gives a really nice glowy finish to your skin if you spritz yourself after doing your makeup. Love it as a pick me up as well, but that’s more of an emotional benefit.

4.0,Feels good if u believe,"I'm not sure any rose spray really does anything noticeable for your complexion, but something about a light, cool mist on your face sure does feel good. Then again plain water can give me the same feeling. This product, however, has a nicer fragrance than plain H2O and leaves a silky, albeit slightly sticky, film of moisture on your skin that feels hydrating. The film sinks into your skin rather quickly and the cool softness lasts only a few moments longer. The sprayer is simple, but efficient in delivering a light mist. It does not spray a super fine mist, but it is light enough. This, I suspect, is because the supplied bottle is a rather ordinary one. My daughter and I don't mind that. We actually think the simplicity of the bottle is cute.

5.0,I really liked this product.,"The product is very good, this brand really wanted to try it, since the first time I put it on my face I felt the sensation, my skin felt incredibly fresh, but it bothered me a little in the eyes when applying it because my eyes are sensitive . But in the rest I really like the effect it does so I prevent it from falling into my eyes and I better apply an aloe gel, I think the version of this splay in rose water is not so much for me so I will buy the one of Aloe, I'm sure that will work much better for my whole face.<br />It is not much product so if you are going to use it every day several times you will realize that it ends quickly so I recommend that you buy a larger boat if you want to always use it. No doubt the product packaging can improve, because it only has one bag that could prevent the spilled product from spilling even more. So they should improve the packaging. But if the product does not arrive spilled in general it looks very beautiful and is very good. I love this brand. I will buy these products again in the version that is best for my skin.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612IRNbZPKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612IRNbZPKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612IRNbZPKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N30eIH-gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N30eIH-gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N30eIH-gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002LC9OES,B0C5WPD2RN,AEIUFMBMADJBUG6M6Z56KFJO4VJQ,2019-07-25 22:20:09.696,8,True

These give the skin a natural dewy appearance as opposed to a highlight-like sheen or shimmer. They won’t make your makeup last longer (not in my experience), but they will make it meld and fuse with the skin for a more blended result.",[],B074Z2HFBW,B0C5WPD2RN,AHRUKITFUL7MDX6EVPTOOWWODOZA,2020-01-21 23:56:21.424,0,True

I even thought that at one point maybe the ingredients in my regular routine just don’t work with this. I had patience and  utilized the internet to see what I could do. And alas nothing helpful, and nothing good and my face got worse. I would like to make it clear that I do not have sensitive skin. Do your research about this brand before buying. Just because it failed for me, doesn’t mean it’ll fail for you. But to be fair I have it a chance I really tried but this brand failed. The ingredients are the best quality of what they could be.

I give it two stars because I did like the scent a lot, even though it smelled perfume-y. And the spray did make my face look moisturized and “dewy”, but only at the cost of breaking out.

5.0,Listen up oily Gals/boys,"So.... I have personally bought this at an Ulta and I saw all of the negative reviews on here about the harsh chemicals they put in here. Let’s be straight, there is only ONE harsh chemical and there has been research done saying that it doesn’t cause any damaging effects to your skin. The chemical was only meant to preserve the organic ingredients included. Sometime having something TOO organic can actually cause harmful reactions to a lot of people. But anyways to my review.<br /><br />This product is GREAT for my oily, big pores skin. It sprays on my face so gently and I especially love using it when it super hot outside. It keeps my skin refreshed and awake throughout the day. I also use it to set my makeup!! It has multiple purposes. I don’t know if a lot of the people complaining have very dry skin, but I can honestly say I love the way my skin looks. It keeps my skin looking glowing and it makes me look so youthful. I seriously recommend to the oily people out there!! It is perfect!! Seriously GET IT!!",[],B002LC9OES,B0C5WPD2RN,AH3OPXZFIKATH27EHRG2HD5SOSWA,2020-03-26 06:54:57.736,1,False

I have been wanting to try this mist for quite some time, and decided to add it on to my order last minute, however when I received it, the cap was loosened and the bottle was greasy to the touch—(some product leaked)which made me hesitant to put it on my face. I decided to try anyways. I’m giving 2 stars because I liked the smell, and imagine it is refreshing, but I don’t see my self using it very often as the sprayer malfunctions. Rather than coming out as an even spray or mist, it mist from the top and comes out in big droplets from the bottom.

3.0,"Wouldn't recommend for oily complexion, smells nice though","I consider this product more useful as a perfume than a facial spray. I didn't care for the scent at first but it's grown on me. I spritz it on after yoga or after a hard bike ride. It covers up the smell of BO pretty well since the rose scent is so strong, but only temporarily - It dissipates completely after a few minutes. I have an oily complexion and spraying this on my face doesn't do much to alleviate the issue.

5.0,My Favorite Facial Spray!,"I have been using this particular product for almost a year straight now. It took that long before I had to replace my bottle of near daily use.<br /><br />Mario Badescu has hit it on the head with this one. It sprays a decent amount of product. I usually only spray 1-2 sprays and that about does it for my entire face. The smell is really great, but if you have a sensitive nose or can't do a super blast mist in the face then I probably wouldn't recommend this to you. The spray nozzle is perfect for me however. One of my favorite things is how quickly it moisturizes. I always use it right after washing my face with a cleanser that won't clog my pores. It gives my skin a very nice soft feel before I even apply my normal moisturizers. What else is so great that not only does it tone and moisturize but it can also be used as a setting spray. I would recommend using it as a setting spray during the winter rather the summer because of how cooling it is. I have sprayed more than one layer over my makeup during the winter and it never pulled any of it off and kept my face from becoming dry.

1.0,NOT worth the irritation.,"DO NOT BUY THIS.<br /><br />I purchased this for two reasons: 1) an extra boost of moisture 2) I love the smell.<br />I was using it for about 2 weeks, after washing my face for moisture and I even used it to set my makeup. I started noticing these small bumps that weren't pimples on my face and it turns out it was the rose water causing it. The chemicals in this, particularly, geraniol, can irritate your skin. The flower extracts pose a risk for irritation too. t's been 2 weeks since I stopped using it and my skin is going back to normal but very very slowly.<br />All in all, I would not recommend, it's simply not worth it taking such a risk with this product. I'm sure some people use it with no issue, but those people probably used the older version of this mist, which had a shorter ingredient list.<br />Even if you end up being lucky enough to not be irritated, it does not do wonders to your skin, so save your money and most importantly your skin from this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jx2mJdddL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeUeDvJVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00172O9NO,B0C5WPD2RN,AFZAJMLMUOM5U2QAPTZ6BDOXU3ZA,2016-12-07 01:44:24.000,295,True
