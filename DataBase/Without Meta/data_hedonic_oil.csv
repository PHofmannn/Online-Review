5.0,The best!!!,"I use this on my hands and nails/cuticles.  I just got my order so I don‚Äôt know about long term usage benefits but my nails are pretty strong and grow fast anyway so I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see a difference on that front.  I got the Milk & Honey version and it is simply luxurious!  I‚Äôd like a stronger scent because it is so nummy yet I would rather have a fragrance that is too soft and fleeting (like this oil) than one that is overbearing and lingering.  At least this way I know it won‚Äôt interfere with any other fragrance I might want to wear.<br /><br />I had been a long time user of CND Solar Oil and Bliss Kiss Cuticle Oil but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll bother with them after trying this!  The Cuccio oil absorbs into my skin faster than some lotions!  I wouldn‚Äôt dare put the other two oils I‚Äôve used all over my hands but this oil has a trifecta going for it.  Fast absorbing, not heavy/thick, and makes my hands look much healthier.  Even after 2-3 minutes my palms may look like there‚Äôs still a little oil on the skin‚Äôs surface but they‚Äôre not slick at all.

5.0,Performs Miracles,"Having problem cuticles and nails due to nail biting in youth was compounded midlife by medical condition resulting in thin, dry/no luster nails and dry rough cuticles made worse by several years of faux nails.

Cuccio showed a difference after one application and after a week, I did not recognize my nails and cuticles.  I applied daily the first two weeks but then life took over and I was only applying once or twice a week.  My nails retained the soft luster and my cuticles did not get rough and ragged.  My nails even seem to have slightly thickened which is wonderful as they were tissue thin.  One bottle will last for more than a year as it require only a minute dollop every other nail then massaging it into each nail bed/cuticle.

There's about 1/3rd of the base of the bottle that is intentionally slanted at around 45 degrees.

5.0,Milk and Honey,"OH my GOSSSSHHH!!! This smells DIVINE! Something about this smell reminds me of Taiwan (where I spent most of my summers growing up and into adulthood). Funny enough I got this when I got back from a trip back to Taiwan and instantly it brought me back to that island. I'm so in love with this oil I'm using it as my hand moisturizer (which was something my nail lady told me to do anyway).  I had pretty severely dry hands and I told my nail lady I've tried all the lotions, creams, sealants I could buy and she told me to use cuticle oil instead. What what? How would cuticle oil help with so many frequent hand washes? IDK but it DOES! It feels pretty moisturizing and it absorbs pretty quickly into my skin.

5.0,"OK, I bought this for my wife, but I'll tell you what I know....","She LOVES this!<br /><br />I mean, I scored such big points buying this, you have no idea!<br /><br />My wife recently went for a manicure and the person that did her nails told her she needed to use a cuticle oil.  Usually that means, order something for me.<br /><br />So I came on here to Amazon and read a few things, and luckily found this.  My wife RAVES about it everyday.  She literally thanks me, like I'm the one that made it.  She shows me everyday how much better things are and she isn't always complaining, so I got that going for me too.<br /><br />I did read in a review about a ""pen"" you put this oil in, so after about 10 days of her using it, I surprised her with a stocking stuffer present of a pack of three pens.  It makes putting this stuff on easier and neater.<br /><br />But don't tell anyone, but I use one of her pens too.  This dry weather has been taking a toll on my hands and I have more than normal hang nails.  Using this is great.<br /><br />This has a pleasant smell, and not oily, but I do see why the wife likes it.<br /><br />The bottle seems to be a great size that for what I see, it should last a long while.  The bottle can sit upright, but there is a ""dimple"" on the side, where you can tilt it too.  But the pens are worth looking into.<br /><br />Two word review:  Great Stuff",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AE23LDQTB7L76AP6E6WPBFVYL5DA,2021-12-29 00:18:20.769,3,True
5.0,"Nice scent, non-greasy, hydrating Cuticle Oil... Weird tingle first 3 applications....","I have been using this oil for about a week and a half.  Although I did a test swatch on my arm with no problem, when I put this on my cuticles I felt an odd tingly sensation for the first 3 applications.  I could have stopped using it, but I didn't have any swelling or itching -- just an weird tingle -- so I kept applying it once or twice a day.  After day 3 the sensation went away.  My cuticles are soft and supple and adding the oil doesn't cause a tingle anymore.<br /><br />I was worried about the Smell based on other reviews. I bought the Pomegranate and Fig just because it was a Prime purchase and was returnable while the Milk and Honey, which was the same price, was listed as non-returnable. I can't speak to the Milk and Honey scent, but the Pomegranate is awesome... slightly sweet but not overpowering at all.  And... once the oil blends in and ""dries"" the smell is barely noticeable (if at all).<br /><br />I was also worried about the bottle spilling because it's unique design. I solved this by keeping it in, and using it from, the clear plastic case it is shipped in.  Once I knew I was keeping it, I bought a cheap clear lucite box to store it in and that holds it in place while I use it.

The texture is runny (more like water vs oil) and it isn't thick or greasy at all. I have a dead sea mineral oil cuticle oil that is much thicker and feels more moisturizing than this one. This one doesn't feel like it is a good barrier so if you have dry air in your home, don't expect this to work miracles. It helps dry crunchy cuticles in the moment, but wouldn't last overnight or all day as a moisture barrier. Vaseline is better suited for an overnight cuticle treatment in Winter.

After trimming my cuticles, filing & buffing my nails I slater on this oil and it does what I need it to do. My nails aren't splitting or chipping as they were when I didn't use a cuticle oil, so I am pretty satisfied with that result. My nails also use to be weak, thin & had ridges.. Using a cuticle oil along with collagen peptide powder has turned that around. My nails are looking so healthy, and youthful.

5.0,Great cuticle oil,"I love this cuticle oil! It's moisturizing but also light and absorbs in easily without leaving my hands too greasy. The milk and honey scent is light and pleasant but I wouldn't say it's an exact match to the Cuccio hand and body butter in the coordinating scent. This isn't a huge deal breaker for me because the cuticle oil scent isn't very strong so the scents still play well together. The eye dropper style is convenient and feels fancy but I'm also not a huge fan of the base of the bottle. It has a cut flat across the bottom with a little bit cut out diagonally so that as the oil is used, you can set it sideways on your table. I think this will become convenient, but while it's full, you have to be careful so that the bottle doesn't tip over towards the diagonal cut and spill. So far I've been able to manage without spilling it as long as I'm aware of how I'm setting it back down.",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AF47XWCZNBAOPQ5FKSWPPZWCBJ7A,2020-08-02 15:10:18.271,0,True

1.0,Fake synthetic perfume extract,"The scent in all of these is horrid because they are using synthetic chemicalized extracts and outright perfume. The scents are terrible because they are not natural and are so strong that they hang around forever; you cannot get rid of the smell! Even after washing your hands thoroughly, even after washing them multiple times, that scent is still there. People sensitive to synthetic fragrances may get a headache from this product. By the way, ""extracts"" are not natural, even though manufacturers often say that they are. Extracts are processed synthetic perfume products and unhealthy. They cause many people to get headaches.<br /><br />In addition, this cuticle oil is very greasy and never wants to completely sink in. The ingredients overall are not that great. Several poor quality oils are used, not the better moisturizing ones, and the cottonseed oil is likely GMO (genetically modified) and probably contaminated with pesticide and herbicide residue.<br /><br />Give this cuticle oil a pass. If you still want to get it anyway, I would recommend only ordering the unscented version!

5.0,High quality and affordable cuticle oil,"The bottle is huge! Feels like a lifetime supply of cuticle oil! I fill the twisting refill tube with the cuticle oil and it is a much more convenient to use. The oil texture is thick, much thicker then other cuticle oil I used before. I would apply a copious amounts of the oil before I peel off the gel polish (I use the cuccio peel off gel base coat). After peeling off the gel, I will apply another thick coat of the oil and massage it to the cuticle and nails, and the remaining to my hands, arms until all the oil is absorbed.

5.0,White Limetta & Aloe Vera,"I bought the ""White Limetta & Aloe Vera"" scent after I debated between a safe scent or a take-a-risk scent. I've got to say that I'm glad i took a chance--I love it! It's different, but delicate and citrusy. It says extract of lime, lemon,  and bergamot + aloe juice. I smelled mint in there, instead of bergamot. The oils used are safflower, sunflower, cotton seed, and vegetable, and together, make a smooth, light mix. I rub it all over my hands and into my cuticles. I've not tried it on my body yet, but i don't see why it wouldn't be awesome there! To me, it seems to absorb well... not excessively greasy (I mean, it IS oil, though, so expect a little). Try rubbing it into your skin when it's damp... oil absorbs better, then. Some oils (like avocado, for example) are much thicker and heavier, though, and these aren't like that. Anyway, I really like it and am excited to try the others! Btw, my bottle was a 2.5fl.oz. sphere. I think it's a cool bottle and it will add a nice addition to my glass bottle collection. It would also be great to reuse when I make my own concoctions. I can see why some people are bent out of shape. The dropper doesn't go all the way to the bottom or easily angle when you tilt it to the side.

Winter is very mean to my hands.  Add to that the constant washing and hand sanitizers I‚Äôve been using and my skin is like sandpaper.  I rub this into my cuticles and my very dry hands.

5.0,Actually works!  Great product.,"I read that if your toenails weren't brittle but your fingernails were, it wasn't something missing from your diet and supplements would not help.

I‚Äôve been using this oil for a week now, and a different oil for a few weeks prior. This is the perfect cuticle oil, love the large size because it will last me longer since I use it so often.

It absorbs really quickly and doesn't feel super oily or leave a oily film/residue and I love how light the fragrance is (I have a fragrance sensitivity so I don't like heavy scented things.)<br /><br />I get my nails done pretty frequently, more than most I think in the grand scheme of things. I enjoy a fresh set of nails or just a clean manicure/pedicure. My favorite cuticle cream/care before this was Burts Bees lemon butter cuticle cream. It is still my favorite now only for how well it keeps my hands and cuticles healthy looking but also for the smell. But oh my gosh Becky I am completed OBSESSED with this Cuccio oil. I think I spent $9 for the 2.5 fl.oz. bottle and its going to last forever.<br /><br />I put it on my desk at work with my hand lotion because I work in an office and all the hand washing, typing, paperwork, etc was killer on my hands - lotion alone wasn't cutting it for me, the oil is a nice fast way to get the extra care my hands need without derailing my day for 20-25 minutes while the oil absorbs.

As other reviewers have noted, there is a flat section on the side, near the bottom, that I guess is meant to let you tilt the bottle to get more product out --- but it also makes the bottle unstable and really easy to tip over.<br />2. It comes with a dropper which releases way too much product & makes for a very messy application -- a brush would be much better for applying over the entire cuticle and nail. I'm going to buy a small empty nail polish bottle with a brush, and decant the oil into it.<br />Finally, the scent is pretty bad, like rancid coconut.

5.0,BIG BOTTLE,"This is a huge bottle compared to the usual cuticle oil I would get. Here they are side by side. This oil bottle has an indentation at the bottom of the glass for letting you lean it, I suppose for when the oil is running low.

There's been many near catastrophes with the bottle toppling over from the desk being hit by my knee or just careless bumping of it as I grab something next to it.<br /><br />The oil is a lightweight concoction with a very minimal smell. It dissipates quickly for anyone with severe allergy concerns. I'm allergic to nearly all fragrances, but this is so minute, and an eau de toilette type that it doesn't bother me.

It can stand upright and it has a slanted flat piece underneath so you can tilt it back and let it stand that way.

4.0,Decent product,"I just received my item, thankful all was in tact with no spills etc. The first thing I noticed is an odd shape to the bottle. The bottle doesn‚Äôt sit flat, but instead is angled; however, that angle isn‚Äôt wide enough. Therefore some of the bottle stays lifted (please see pictures for details). In addition, the scent doesn‚Äôt smell like pomegranate but rather perfumey with a bubblegum scent. I don‚Äôt mind it, but others sensitive to smell may The oil itself seems hydrating, not too light or heavy and a little goes a long way. For the price I do consider it a decent product, but I did purchase to hydrate my skin, not as a treatment for broken nails or dry cuticles etc.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K+Vf3MCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K+Vf3MCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710K+Vf3MCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3Z4l7FYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3Z4l7FYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S3Z4l7FYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W5g9ENq6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W5g9ENq6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W5g9ENq6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldPlxTOVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldPlxTOVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldPlxTOVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMw2Fd2sL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMw2Fd2sL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMw2Fd2sL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644L32,B09GWLJPTH,AGJHX7YGEYR2YVYRA2LPWFIEMMDQ,2020-08-20 20:12:38.201,0,True

If you live somewhere with an exceptionally dry climate, I would keep looking, because this doesn't help enough to make much of a difference. Also, confirming the other reviews, the bottle is weirdly shaped. It tips over all the time, but there is a ledge that catches it from totally tipping over.

2.0,"Smells great, but didn‚Äôt work for me.","Application: I do not recommend using the oil straight out of the bottle. Since the bottle was big and hard to work with, I loaded this cuticle oil into a disposable pen brush for easier application.<br /><br />Scent: I really love the smell of the milk & honey oil. It can be a little strong if you‚Äôre sensitive to smells.<br /><br />Effectiveness: For me, this oil is quick to absorb into the skin, and worked really well to moisturize my cuticles at first. However, after a few days of consistent use, I found that it leaves my cuticles drier than before - almost like my cuticles are ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to the oil. I needed more and more frequent applications of the oil throughout the day to avoid my cuticles drying out.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this cuticle oil for everyone. I personally have much better results with a homemade mixture of jojoba oil and vitamin E oil, with a few drops of essential oil mixed in for fragrance. Jojoba oil (which is not an ingredient in the Cuccio oil) is the most similar to the sebum naturally produced by the human skin, and therefore moisturizes very effectively without feeling heavy.",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AFJ3YNWPJXF56HW6Q764423E5HWA,2021-09-23 15:52:40.525,1,True

5.0,Heavenly scent...,"When I was in high school ( I'm now 62) I had lovely nails. They were strong and grew long. Your would think, now that I'm no longer working, and I use gloves when I clean/ wash dishes, that my nails would thrive, but such is not the case. My nails are literally like onion skin... they peel, are brittle and split... at times down to the quick. I have to cut them so close to the nail bed that they are sore for several days. Yet, last summer, they grew to be the longest in years!!  And for the life of me I can't think of what I did differently. My diet did not change either. I use 'Perfect Formula' clear gel as a base coat, and have for several years.  I take vit. D because I have one kidney. My last resort was to try a cuticle oil, and/or to perhaps try a multivit... or a vit. that is targeted towards nail growth. We'll see what happens with this. It smells and feels divine. It absorbs 'fairly' quickly. It does leave a residue on my phone, I've noticed. But that is not a deal breaker. I'm still trying to guage how much to apply so that it does not drip down my fingers (I've only had this for a couple of days).

Throughout the day, my hands felt drier than usual, and I was using more lotion in between handwashings than I had been before using this oil.  I thought it was due to first time use so I used it again the second night by itself without the lotion and the next morning my cuticles were still dried out and in fact worse with peeling. I then switched to my former Deborah Lippmann cuticle oil to help repair my cuticles, which took about two weeks to get them back to baseline.

5.0,Highly recommended for problem nails,"As long as I can remember, I have had horrible nails. They have always been thin and split very easily; it was always very embarrassing. As soon as I was old enough, I began going to the salon for acrylics, gels, powder...ugh!  The time and money invested!  Then, I'd get sick of going and peel them off at home (very painful and very bad) and go back to my ugly nails for awhile until I couldn't stand them anymore and begin the cycle again.  Most recently, after peeling them off yet again, I tried &#34;vitamins&#34; guaranteed to make my nails (and hair-added bonus) grow and grow strong! Took them for two months-total waste. Then I tried this. It has done what nothing else could. I massage it in before going to work and before going to bed. It's a little greasy, but I massage it into my hands as a treat for my skin. It smells great and the bottle lasts a long time. I really am impressed.

5.0,Amazing cuticle oil that completely repaired my nails,I‚Äôm an avid gel polish wearer. I love my gel mani on my natural nails and recently I decided to remove my gel mani by myself at home because it started to weaken my long natural nails. First - horrible idea because I was impatient with scraping the polish off.. I used pretty strong acetone and a metal nail tool but little did I know I wasn‚Äôt supposed to harshly scrape the nail because the acetone is already so harsh on nails. After I was left with dry nails with some white spots where I had damaged my nails from scraping too hard. I‚Äôve been using the oil religiously for about two weeks after I wash my hands and before bed - I even keep a small bottle of it at my work desk. My nails are feeling stronger and no longer have the white spots (which I read could take 3 months to repair on their own). I love the milk and honey scent. Sweet but not too strong.

3.0,I personally found these underwhelming.,"I got both the Milk & Honey and Pomegranate & Fig scents.<br /><br />The good: This is a pretty large bottle for a pretty great price. So, even if you end up not liking it, you will not have laid out a lot of money for it (and cuticle oils can get pretty expensive.)<br /><br />The meh: I am really not a fan of either scent. Lots of other reviews rave about the scent, but they both smell a little cheap and artificial to me (and I am not a person who is picky about making sure her products only use natural scents. Like, one of my favorite lotions is OPI's Coconut Melon Avojuice lotion, and it is not something I'd describe as natural-smelling, just well-executed.) However, I do not find either scent overpowering or truly offensive, and scent preferences are pretty subjective. So, unless you are particularly sensitive to fragrances, you'll probably be able to manage, even if you don't love the fragrance.<br /><br />Additionally, these products use a dropper, not a brush. I prefer a brush, especially in order to be able to apply to the underside of the free edge (the part that extends past your actual finger, which is crucial, especially if you are wearing polish.) With these, I have to try to drop a teeny bit under each one, which is still too much while not actually getting the entire underside, and it just kind of pools in the area where the nail and finger meet. With a brush, I can control the amount of oil much better, and get the entire underside. Although, Amazon does sell refillable oil brushes that you could use for this purpose; it will just make the one thing this product really has going for it (an attractive price point) a little less attractive. I guess you could also use a nail art brush, but I feel like unless you have a specific, dust-free place to keep it and/or you are diligent about cleaning it, then it will get dirty/grimy awfully quickly, or get nail oil all over your other stuff (and it overall detracts from the ""ease of use"" factor. Every other dedicated nail/cuticle oil I have ever used had a brush.)<br /><br />Not exactly bad, but sub-meh: None of the oils in this cuticle oil (safflower, sunflower, cotton seed, vegetable) are *particularly* well-known for their moisturizing properties, although a naturally, plant-derived oil will be moisturizing to some degree. Some people absolutely swear by jojoba-based cuticle oils; presumably, it is the *most* like skin's natural oil, and is supposed to absorb best. Supposedly, there is some science to back this up, but the biggest proponent of this science is also someone who makes a cuticle oil. It's a good product that I have used and liked, but it is on the expensive side. Still, I personally have good luck with a blend of jojoba/vitamin E oils; I find it does absorb quickly, whereas these Cuccio oils just kind of sit on my fingers (even after massaging it into my nails and cuticles) and I find I have to wipe some off (although some of this might be related to the over-application that just kind of naturally happens because of the dropper delivery mechanism.) I also do not feel these oils moisturize quite as well as the jojoba-based oils I use. However, your own personal body chemistry also plays a role here, so you may find jojoba a bad choice for you, and this oil blend a great choice for you.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you are looking for something to try to help parched cuticles, but don't need to care about making sure it ""absorbs into your nails,"" or you're just starting to get into nail care and don't want to spend a small fortune, this oil might be worth a try for you. Especially if you are diligent about using it regularly, several times a day, and actually massaging it in - a good deal of the nail-growing benefit comes from the massaging your cuticles/nail beds, which helps stimulate circulation/new cell growth (as well as just kind of generally making you mindful of your nails overall, which will in turn make you more careful of how you use your hands and less likely to do things like popping open cans of soda, or using your nails as tools, or other things that lead to breaks.) But, personally, I have other oils I would recommend over this brand (not the least of which is a big old bottle of jojoba oil with a little vitamin E oil thrown in - fragrance-free, so it won't overpower, or interfere with your favorite lotion, and if you buy the 4oz size, can be had as cheaply as $10 or so; while you might also have to get some Vitamin E oil and a brush pen, you only use a little of the Vitamin E, and the bursh pens are reusable, so both will last through several bottles of jojoba oil, and so the total cost is on par, if not cheaper, than these products.)",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AEKEYEH2DAKYYWFQJHCUPEWKMGVA,2019-08-21 03:34:40.933,13,True

5.0,"Good non greasy oil for nails, hands and feet",I really like this oil!  Smells great and is very hydrating for dry cuticles on both hands and feet! Very decent size for the price.

It has a base that will stand securely upright or on a slant!  This oil is great after doing your manicure but it is my staple last step at night!

It is perfect for helping keep your fingers away from your face and mouth because who likes oil in their mouth or all over their face ?? Its also amazing for nail growth .

But the real takeaway here is how strong my nails are since using it. They used to grow quite frail and thin, easily snapping off. But now, I grew them out to a nice length and only one nail has broken in the last month.

5.0,It‚Äôs very easy to use and nourish nails - great!,I have had the same bottle for about 3 years.  It works better than any nail product. I have collected many products to do nails at home since the pandemic ruined the nail salon pleasure.

They wait in line on Tuesday mornings for me and my huge supply of products to make the nails ready to polish and they get to pick from the 60+ colors I‚Äôm carrying.  So much fun - giving men manicures slid and use this oil on them when done.<br />LOVE THIS STUFF !!,[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AGRTH7JEZ2RHR7AKOHM76LDQP6HQ,2020-10-21 21:52:52.122,0,True

5.0,This oil is rad!,"Honestly, for a budget cuticle oil, this stuff SLAPS. It's not super quick to soak in like some other cuticle-specific oils, but the price makes it all worth it.

So far, this oil has completely taken care of them!<br />As someone mentioned, the Milk & Honey scent smells identical to the Softsoap liquid soap of the same variety but it's kind of nostalgic in a way for me. It goes away quickly, too. I use it multiple times a day when it's dry.<br />It takes about 10 minutes to dry. I'm usually working on my computer, so I often get grease all over it because I'm impatient, but that's my fault. It's not sticky and the smell isn't overpowering. Keep in mind that the bottle does have a notch in it so it can fall over if you don't have it propped against something while it's open or you're a klutz like me.<br />This has helped my nails grow and kept my cuticles nice and soft! 100% worth it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKQGsYMkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKQGsYMkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKQGsYMkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AHF2QF5RG36WAUU3AN4IUMMMN2VQ,2020-10-22 01:42:15.791,0,True

It worked okay, but expensive for only 5ml. I found this oil and read some of the reviews, decided to give it a try. I have been very happy with the results. Not only are my cuticles soft, but so is the skin around my nails. The scent is light and the oil absorbs in quickly (20-25 min.), the little hand/finger massage is a nice relaxing bonus.

I would get horrible hang-nails as a result which would bleed because they would split so far down. With this product all of that has stopped and my skin is hydrated and soft and no longer white and painful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this valuable product.

1.0,Non-Absorbing Scented Oil,"Pros: Cheap, Smells Good<br /><br />Cons: Everything Else<br /><br />Not sure if I just got a bad batch or what but this oil does not absorb at all. Just sits on your fingers forever. Their instructions state one drop per cuticle, which by the way, is WAYYY too much (you'll have oil all over your hands). 2-3 drops per HAND is sufficient. They also state to rub it in, we'll rubbing does nothing but spread it around as it never absorbs. I rubbed, let set, and rubbed multiple times then waited up to 45 minutes. No change in absorption, just shiny oily fingers. Mixing it in with hand lotion seemed to help considerably but probably defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Second, the bottle has a slant on the bottom which makes it unstable. If you even look at it wrong, it'll tip over. What is even the point of this slant? Just make a normal bottle.<br /><br />However, I will say this oil smells amazing. Not sure what use I'll have with that alone but good job on this point.<br /><br />But you get what you pay for. Not sure what all these 5 star reviews are ranting on about as I had literally the opposite results.

In the morning I can feel a difference with how soft they feel so I will continue to use this. I like how it doesn‚Äôt leave your cuticles feeling like they are super oily and it absorbs really well. My cuticles tend to dry out fast because I wash my hands all the time at work. So when I found this I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot! And I‚Äôm glad I did!!! It came safely packaged which was really nice. The only problem I have is a fear of it tipping over while on the carpet because of the bottle design.

5.0,Fantastic for very dry nails & skin,"I usually research products extensively before buying, but I impulsively bought this based on price &description, which was fortunate because I love this cuticle oil.

I have very dry skin and nails (and hair, eyes, you name it) and this oil really ""sticks around"", as it were. Some cuticle oils have a thinner consistency that soaks in immediately, which can be convenient for going about your day, but they don't provide the deeper nourishment truly dry skin and nails crave. This one does and at a fantastic price. You can also easily decant this into a fillable nail oil pen for on the go.

3.0,"Smells Incredible, But Stains Polish","My first thought when I used this product was that it smelled great! I put a drop on the back of my hand just to enjoy the scent.

I don‚Äôt feel I have enough control about how much goes on my cuticles. I also found it to be a bit greasier than I‚Äôd like. Even after thoroughly rubbing the oil in, you still have to wipe your hands well with a cloth or paper towel. But the biggest problem was that it left an orange tint on my nail polish. I used it at bedtime a day after doing my nails. The next morning, one finger looked just a little orange at the base of the nail. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. I figured there might have been a small crack or peel that allowed a touch of the oil in. But then after using it again, a few more nails developed an orange tint.

I have extremely dry cuticles, but this product healed and moisturized them immediately. Very high quality, natural and effective. The scent is completely natural as well, just like fresh lavender in the garden. The added chamomile has healing properties, and my cuticles are thankful for that. Heals and moisturizes my cuticles, makes my nails shiny, and using the oil on my fingers in the evening is an aroma therapy ritual I look forward to every day.

2.0,Honestly?....No.,"So - I hate to be the critic but I have to be honest. This cuticle oil did NOTHING for me. I keep my nails relatively long (1/2 inch - 1 inch long) and ran out of my jojoba oil and Cutex cuticle oil. I had a gift card and purchased this oil back in May and have been using every day since. It smells wonderful and the bottle looks good. BUT the cap cracked shortly after purchasing, the oil feels good on the skin but it just doesn‚Äôt absorb enough into the skin or nail and actually made my skin drier than usual. Water alone was more moisturizing! My nails have dry cracks running through them 5 minutes after applying, like I put nothing on! I unfortunately followed the hype of this product because of the reviews - but the ingredients are not very good for the intentions of the product. Safflower oil, sunflower oil are oils that just SIT on the skin. They DO NOT penetrate. No wonder!

I was using a cuticle oil and then a cuticle cream I had on hand.  The patches were not improving.<br />Then I ordered the Milk & Honey Cuticle Revitalizing Oil.  Amazing!

My nails look fake they are so pretty! Total transformation. Also, a little goes a long way, I could probably use the oil as I have been every week and it should last maybe 6 months.

3.0,Lid does not secure!! (UPDATED),"(Update: I received the new product again in great condition. Been using the oil for two weeks now. It does its job and moisturizes my cuticles, nothing too extraordinary. I saw some reviews saying the dropper releases way too much product, but I had no trouble with it. Overall, good product for it‚Äôs price point.)<br />‚Äî<br />ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.. Before I even opened the package, I could already smell the product. When I opened it I found that almost half of the oil had leaked out. Inside the package, the product came in a little clear box AND it was bubble wrapped. So obviously the the movement of the delivery truck didn't magically untwist the lid. Maybe the lid should come with a plastic seal or something, I mean should be a pretty important feature if you‚Äôre delivering an oil with a weak lid. Seriously a waste of money..

5.0,Skin Pickers Dream Come True!!,I never write reviews but I feel like this is such a dream come true that I had to! I‚Äôve been using this oil every now and then for about a month and it has been so helpful.

Maybe it‚Äôs just put conscious effort into my nails or what but I think it also smooths the skin down so I can‚Äôt pick it. The bottle is huge (I added a comparison photo next to a hair clip) so you‚Äôre definitely going to get plenty of product. I‚Äôm honestly so happy I gave this a try!

5.0,OMG Winner!!,"I was searching for a cuticle oil and came across this one. The positive reviews made this an easy choice and the price. WOW! The first application, my skin quickly absorbed the oil. You only need a drop which goes a long way. I massaged around my cuticles and into my hands. The next day, my second application,  after washing my hands, I repeated the process.  A drop and begin massaging. The fragrance is amazing.  I'm very, very sensitive to fragrances, but this one is mild. I couldn't stop smelling my hands. Even though it's oil, it's not greasy. My fingers peel around my cuticles like peeling onions.  The peeling is minimal, and it's only my second application.<br />I noticed I have a nice sheen on my skin and my hands don't look so old.<br /><br />I know certain products don't work for all, but this one is a winner!",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AF7DCI4OPGKJBYZYUZDHH2H5JD6Q,2022-12-11 04:25:17.816,16,True

I saw that this cuticle oil had so many good reviews so I bought it along with the onyx stop the bite nail polish. I no longer bite my nails and they‚Äôre longer than they‚Äôve been in a year! I definitely recommend the nail polish for people who also struggle with nail biting like I did, it stopped me from biting my nails within the first day!

5.0,Very good üëçüèΩ oil and great value!,"So first let me start by saying this oil is the BEST CUTICLE OIL  compared to CND Solar Cuticle Oil and Flowery Cuticle Oil. Both CND and Flowery smell nice and get the job done, but I use Cuticle oil on my toes, nails and hands every day, including when I wash and sanitize my hands so I run through the bottles pretty quickly.  Using this new CUCCIO OIL is a game changer.  It makes my hands feel buttery soft w/out a heavy residue.  I love how it makes my hands  look healthier and revitalized.  I feel like it's doing a better job than the other brands I've previously mentioned.  I love the dropper. You don't even have to squeeze it...just rub or dab so on your cuticle and drop a little on your hand, rub it all in and you will be happy that you did.  Not to mention,  the amount you get in those bottles 0.25 fl oz and 0.5 oz bottle, all  over $8 and for a little more than $8 you get this  2.5fl LARGE  BOTTLE. This CUCCIO is all that people have made it out to be. I've seen reviews in magazines and on YouTube but I'm not usually one to fall for the hype but....It's üëçüèΩ  Amazing. I initially ordered 2 bottles, one for my home, one for my office, and added the roll on bottle for my purse. I'm glad I did because this oil doesn't disappoint!  Not to mention using a good cuticle oil keeps your nails looking fresh. This manicure is over a week old and still looking good to me.

5.0,Great Product.,"This is the best oil I've used. Better than OPI, but I was never impressed with theirs in the first place. Very moisturizing. Soaks right in. If you put it all the way around rather than just dropping it, like the whole cuticle and around the nail, which I do, because my skin gets dry there, you can just leave it be, without massaging it in or anything. This works best if you wash your hands first to let your skin suck up the moisture, but most people know this.<br /><br />Love the smell. The scent is like the that one liquid soap in the milk and honey scent, as someone else mentioned. I can't think of the brand offhand.<br /><br />Not sure what everyone's problem is with the packaging. The bottle is huge. I like how there is a flat spot on the side to tilt it. If it gets knocked, it falls on the the side rather than falling over. Dropper seals tight. I can turn it upside down. No leaks.<br /><br />I don't know if it strengthens the nails. I have a genetic disorder. I have acrylics on my hands, or they would rip so bad I would bleed because they are so soft.<br />Basically, they are a like babies nails. My toes are not much better. Stupid soft, so I have to keep them super short, and nothing has ever helped.

5.0,Something that actually works!!!,"I don‚Äôt be write many reviews but have to give credit where it‚Äôs due. I NEVER can grow all 10 nails out. Some break, peel, etc, so I might have a few nice ones but until this product, never 10. Now, I have 10 long strong nails! I‚Äôve used this daily (sometimes multiple times a day) for about a month.

The bottle has a short bottom and a slanted side so that it can sit on its side .... presumably for ease of application.

3.0,"Eh, not bad but not enough hydration","As cuticle oils go, this one isn't horrible. It does help some with dry cuticles, but you need to reapply after every hand washing as it doesn't last through soap and water. The dropper opening lets out a big drop of oil that's more than enough for each nail bed. A smaller dropper opening might have been better for more control over the product. The bottle I chose is fragrance-free, though it still has a faint oil scent. Nothing terrible, though. I like that it doesn't have such a strong smell that it affects anything I eat or drink anytime my hand gets near my nose. Bottle closes securely and doesn't leak if knocked over.  A little pricey even for the large amount you get.<br /><br />This cuticle oil from Cuccio isn't bad. I can't really give it more than three stars as it didn't really do much to improve the dry, raggedy cuticles on my hands and feet. Applying copious amounts didn't make a difference, neither did doing so frequently. Thankfully this oil absorbs quickly and didn't leave my nails a greasy mess. Actually, it's almost as if this oil isn't oily enough, if that makes sense. The consistency is thin - thinner than most other cuticle oils I've tried out in the past, like there is too much water in the formula. I can see this being a good option if you have cuticles that are already in good condition as a way to maintain them. I ended up finishing off the bottle by adding this to my heavy duty winter body butter as a way to up the hydration, and when used this way I did see a difference. Unfortunately, this oil doesn't pack enough of a punch to tackle my horribly dry cuticles.",[],B08X22P7DM,B09GWLJPTH,AF6QHJSY6N5MMHTC5L26QOTX6K3Q,2022-06-23 15:27:51.840,0,False

When on the scent is like a perfumey vanilla and kind of smells like a little fruity to me? I wouldn't repurchase this scent.<br /><br />I think the bottle shape is awkward. When applying to my cuticles I have almost tipped the bottle over a couple times getting the dropper back in to get more product out... it's a little too rolly for me.<br /><br />The dropper goes to the very bottom of the bottle which is GREAT!<br /><br />I can't speak to how to product itself works with softening my cuticles because I just purchased it but overall I am happy with my purchase.,[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AEH27GHFG3OHZAKOX2QIJKZAETIA,2019-03-18 13:29:20.324,0,True

5.0,A perfect oil to keep your nails in great shape.,"This oil is a must have for keeping your cuticles and nails in tip top shape. I recently started wearing acrylic on my nails, and it's amazing how fast your nails and cuticles can dry out. I usually just put the oil on at night before bed. It dispenses great from the dropper, one drop at a time. I put it on the top of the nail in the middle of the cuticle and then work it in. I found it flows around and coats the back of the nail without any effort. I can tell if I've gone a day without using the oil! It absorbs well and softens the skin, cuticle, and I think it also helps my nails. They are not brittle and I've had no problem with the acrylic. After getting the acrylic put on, I read up on the upkeep. Many sites said  if you keep your nails supple, they are able to bend and take more pressure. I believe this to be true. The combination of oils are great and really good for you. The oil, milk & honey scent is very enjoyable. It is not overpowering, very subtle, but I found it to be more on the sweet side.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819JG-wGDQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819JG-wGDQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819JG-wGDQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AGILUNIY7MQP5OQORY552AASVM5A,2016-08-12 03:38:06.000,12,False

I started to take care of my nails but they were still very weak and would tear as soon as I removed the polish product, so I  looked for a cuticle oil to help.<br />I remembered seeing this oil a couple of years ago at a salon and thought the price was really good for the amount you get. Let me tell you... this stuff is AMAZING! My 10 year old daughter, who has always taken great care of her nails, decided to ditch her solar oil and now shares my Cuccio milk and honey oil! We LOVE the scent which is light and a little sweet, like honey. It reminds me of burts bees baby bee bath products. It conditions so incredibly well and my nails seem three times stronger after two weeks of daily use. We have not had any problems with the bottle or dropper. I wish I had a before photo of my nails but I was too embarrassed to take one. I am posting a pic of my current nails with the Cuccio bottle; 5 weeks post biting and two weeks of Cuccio cuticle oil use.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r2Wl59JBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r2Wl59JBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r2Wl59JBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AHOKT3OQ7LHSA64S364ICYAJYXTA,2019-09-16 13:42:29.426,0,True

5.0,Love It!,"This is just what I was looking for! Even though I have oily skin, my cuticles get dry from time to time, and I never had anything that could help me until now! I got the milk and honey for two reasons. First, I knew I was going to like the scent, and secondly I read the ingredients and the milk and honey has better ingredients than the pomegranate one. The bottle is a little bigger than I expected, which is good because that means that there is a lot of product in the bottle. I do not use the dropper directly onto my nails (I use a twistable pen) so I can not say if it dispenses too much or not. I use it at night mostly, and once I put it on, I rub it into my cuticles and my fingers do not stay oily for too long which I like. I have noticed a difference in my cuticles in just the 12 days that I have been using it. I don‚Äôt know if my nails are growing faster because I have not used it for that long, but I have noticed that my nails are a bit more flexible, but it could be a placebo effect.

5.0,Great healing cuticle oil,"I'm terribly hard on my hands, and my fingers always have hang nails, flaky skin around the sides of my nails, and horrible looking cuticles.<br /><br />I bought this cuticle oil, applied it once, and promptly forgot I was going to try to do better for my hands... for an entire week.

No dry skin, no hang nails, who's hands are these anyway?  Surely not mine!<br /><br />All I can say is that somehow applying this stuff once in a week and going about my business as usual, washing dishes, working with power tools, doing yard work, and just living my usual life somehow worked.

5.0,Moisturizing Nail Oil,"I started using nail polish more and more frequently, and I found that my nails were becoming a little bit dry. So, I started researching nail oil, and after reading lots of reviews, I eventually settled on Cuccio.<br />First of all, it smells wonderful. Smell is very important to me, and I was very pleased by the milk and honey scent. I don‚Äôt find it too greasy. I just put a drop on each nail, rub it in, then wipe the excess oil off my skin and go about whatever I was doing. If my nails are particularly dry, I usually just watch TV and let it sit on my nails for 15 or 20 minutes, and I can really tell a difference. My nails are shinier and just seem more neat and healthier.<br />Also, this bottle is BIG. I unfortunately wasn‚Äôt paying attention and knocked the bottle off my desk when it was open. I spilled more than half of the brand new bottle. However, even after using a drop on each nail, more than once a day for a bit over a month, I realized the remainder of the bottle will last me a long time. Overall, I am very pleased with this nail oil and will definitely buy more whenever I run out.",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AHZZ6RBUN4YEAR2OQOYUSEBGXBNQ,2020-02-21 21:42:48.100,1,True

3.0,Fine for basic nail care but nothing more,"As an oil, it‚Äôs pretty messy, and you actually only need about half a drop per nail in my experience. The dropper sort of ‚Äúleaks‚Äù oil, so I just dab the end of the dropper on each nail as opposed to squeezing the dropper from the top. In other words, there‚Äôs enough oil on the tip of the dropper to cover all my cuticles in one go. I suppose that could be a plus in terms of making the product last longer, but to me it seems like a product design error.<br /><br />After I apply the oil to my cuticles, I spend a few minutes massaging into my cuticles. I also spread it outward a bit, onto the nail and the tip of my fingers/toes, since there is so much product to work with (and I have pretty small nails).<br /><br />It takes about 20-30 minutes to fully absorb. Sometimes I will apply a moisturizer afterward, and that seems to help ‚Äúset‚Äù everything and make the oil absorb more quickly. This is currently my preferred method, since it leaves my hands/feet feeling the most moisturized. However, I think this product works best as part of a normal nail care routine, versus a treatment for dry/damaged nails, which is what I was hoping for.<br /><br />The smell is okay. It‚Äôs not bad, but it doesn‚Äôt smell like a natural honey scent. It‚Äôs more like something you would get at Bath & Body Works in that it ‚Äúmimics‚Äù a scent. However, it‚Äôs light enough to smell pleasant and does not overwhelm me or give me a headache.<br /><br />Overall, good product for the price, but I will be looking into purchasing a more high-end product that has more potency.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q5KPNyHkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q5KPNyHkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q5KPNyHkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AHP4W7CH3VXXKY3UORMDN6BRZ3VQ,2019-10-13 16:32:45.457,1,True

5.0,"Healthy nail bed, hello!","I am very satisfied with this cuticle oil. I'm always getting my nails done and like to keep up on my nail bed because my hands tend to get very dry, causing my cuticles to tear. The scent is not overpowering at all, lightly floral and honey based. The oil absorbs quite well with no residue. Very moisturizing and over time makes it easier to manage my cuticles. I also picked up a cuticle cutter which seems to be alot easier when this oil has been applied. I highly recommend this product. Also a great price point for anyone that wants to take care of there cuticles at home vs waiting for the salon. For anyone complaining about the bottle shape, I disagree with the negative reviews. I think it's a very cute design. I understand that I have to hold it when putting the top back in and that doesn't bother me at all. If you're rushing on the other hand and don't take care, you'll end up spilling it so maybe others should consider getting something easier to manage??

5.0,Perfect Product,"I used to be a nail biter, so I'm incredibly happy with how much I've let my nails grow. However, they're extremely weak, brittle, and thin (enough that I can easily bend the nail back and forth). I got this oil in hopes to eventually strengthen my nail and the skin/cuticle (since I also used to pick at that).<br /><br />So far I'm very content with the results. The picture of my nails was taken about 5-10 minutes after applying the oil and they look and feel wonderful. The oil itself smells really nice, though it is a little strong and you might smell it for up to an hour after putting it on (as time goes on though it gets fainter). I got the Pomegranate & Fig oil, and the smell reminds me of being on a tropical beach with flowers and fruit.<br /><br />I was also surprised with the size (considering how cheap it was), because you don't need a lot (of oil) to moisturize your nails/cuticles. A little goes a long way, and a small pin-sized droplet on each nail was enough to cover the nail and the cuticle, as well as the nails and cuticles on my other hand (basically I rubbed the oil on one hand then rubbed my nails/hands together to do my other hand).<br /><br />I don't really have any complaints, but I will say that if you put too much on, your fingers/hand will feel a bit greasy and you'll have to wash them if you plan on doing anything. The times I accidentally put on too much, I just let them sit and soak up as much oil as possible, then gently rinsed my hands and I was good to go, and my hands still felt nice and moisturized.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712wYrcxzRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712wYrcxzRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712wYrcxzRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OZnUQFMvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OZnUQFMvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OZnUQFMvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QR82HVg5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QR82HVg5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QR82HVg5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k0BS+rq1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k0BS+rq1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k0BS+rq1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F644L32,B09GWLJPTH,AE2XIG2BJBP5QHPC5TNYN65MW25Q,2019-08-23 16:27:52.020,7,True

5.0,Works wonders!,I purchased this Cuccio Cuticle Oil on September 25th and received it 6 days later on October 1st. I've been using this cuticle oil for over a month and a half and feel that it has helped my hands look much nicer! It has a pleasant light floral scent and a dry but moisturizing texture that settles nicely into the skin. I put this oil onto my cuticles every morning and use Jergen's lotion over it to add more moisture and seal in the oils. It has significantly improved the appearance of my very dry winter hands and has my cuticles looking much more pink and less jagged!<br /><br />You barely have to use any of the product to nourish all 10 fingers so the price-point is excellent! I love that the bottle has one slightly cut off edge to make dipping into the bottle more convenient and the dropper provided allows precise control over your application.

5.0,Fairy Tale Ending,"I was struggling with dry, brittle and shedding nails for the past 2 years.  It was upsetting because I had very strong, beautiful nails all of my life, people used to think I had wraps of gel manicures but they were my nails with a $10 mani. However, about 2 years ago I stopped going to the salon to get my weekly manicures because I was not happy with all the chemicals I was being exposed to, so I decided to start doing my own nails using organic, 10-free (low toxic) nail products. Long story short, it was not a seamless transition. I tried all of the nail strengthens that were supposed to be awesome, again low toxic and nothing worked. I thought, oh well, I just have to live with these horrible nails now unless I go back to chemicals...no way!<br /><br />One day I decided to try a good cuticle oil, I remember the shop owner of my nail salon mentioning how important cuticle oil is for your nails. This product received such rave reviews I thought, why not?  Fairy tale ending...I got my beautiful strong nails back!  I am so grateful I tried this product!

Just one drop on each finger and rub it in. Simple as that.<br /><br />So far I like it. I will update results after a month, but I think I can recommend this as of right now. Seller was amazing btw.

4.0,"This is a great product, but the bottom of the bottle is the reason why I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars.","The oil is really good and moisturizing. It smells really great too. It has a light scent of soft honey and flowers. It has improved my cuticles a lot by making them look less dry and peely. My cuticles get really dry and so does the area around my cuticle.

The bottle sits on a tilt, and it is a super neat/thoughtful product.<br /><br />I bought this after a sweet lady at the nail salon told me I should use cuticle oil.. and it has only been about a week since I began using this product.. it has dramatically changed the quality of my nails and cuticles.<br /><br />My nails are much healthier and less painful.<br />I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />P.S. if your considering SNS nails... DONT. They file your nail so thin, that your natural bed becomes super damaged and brittle- it‚Äôs a painful and long process to get your natural nails back. It‚Äôs not worth the money in my opinion.

5.0,The best ever. Better than prescription ointments.,"Stop. Don‚Äôt look any further for a cuticle oil. This stuff is amazing.<br /><br />My nails have been crap my entire life. I was 45 years old with crap nails. The thumb nails were deeply ridged beyond anything I‚Äôve ever seen on another human in real life. If you search lichen planus if the nails - that‚Äôs what my thumbs looks like. Deep horizontal grooves. They were also quickly becoming spoon nails. I tried everything. I tried prescription steroid ointments nightly covered by a bandaid and finger cot. Minimal improvement at best. Solar oil helped and I did use it for a long time. Then, I saw this on amazon and ordered yet another product in desperation. It was cheap and I had little to lose.<br /><br />This oil has transformed my nails. I‚Äôve been using it regularly for a month and have seen tremendous improvement. My nails aren‚Äôt perfect but the grooves have actually filled back in and the spoon shape is flattening.<br /><br />I use this probably three times per day. I carry it with me. I put it on at my desk, I use it at night, pretty much any time I see and think to put it on. It has made a tremendous difference, not just in my thumb nails but in all my nails and cuticles, which were always ragged and often painful.<br /><br />I can‚Äôt say enough about this product. It lasts a long time, too. I just ordered another bottle along with refillable oil pens so I can stop carrying around the big bottle. I plan to use this forever.<br /><br />If you have hopeless nails and cuticles, please give this a try.

5.0,Great Cuticle OIl Men & Women,"[[VIDEOID:4a99b5a050ee8a37d82a03be16f92afb]] For $6 this stuff is great. It comes in a nice small glass bottle with a glass dropper.

However, its a nice compliment to keep next to my desk in an attempt to keep my fingers from turning into a sasquatch.

5.0,Everything you need to take care of your fingers in a bottle :),"Before I requested this product, me being me, I was skeptical about all too good to be true claims made on this product page detail. But then again, I thought 82% 5 star ratings out of almost 100,000 reviews couldn‚Äôt be that bad. Well, now I am one of those 82% haha.<br />I have been using this oil on my nails and fingers that get extremely dry during winter for over a week now. I put a generous amount of oil all over my hands right before I go to sleep, and put a little around my nail and cuticle after taking a showering in the morning. I like that this oil isn‚Äôt too heavy nor sticky, rather a bit watery like light oil. And I have been enjoying how this oil made my fingers and nails feel so far!  Of course, I will have to wait a bit longer to comment on its effectiveness with more conviction, but temporary results have been good !<br />It looks like there are many cheaper options on Amazon, but I think everything should be evaluated in terms of quality (performance) vs price.

It hydrates your cuticles on contact but not nourishing over time. I'd have to reapply way too often. I really do feel like I'm just putting on artificial fragrant vegetable oil on my cuticles. Vegetable oil is one of the major ingredients in this oil. You want to look for one that has vitamin E, jojoba oil, and maybe tea tree oil (has anti-fungal properties).  But the bottle shape is really cute and I love the dropper. The design is very smart as well.

5.0,Absolutely wonderful!,"So far this cuticle oil has been proven more effective than other oils simply because the smell is so good, I am encouraged to use it more often. :D Seriously, words can't describe how good the smell of Pomegranate and Fig is! I am willing to sniff it 24/7!<br /> I wish it'd make sense to order the Milk and Honey, too, but it doesn't. The bottle is unexpectedly huge (75ml or 2.5 fl. oz.), meaning it will last me forever. It absorbs well and quickly. The bottle is made of robust plastic, which is also a plus for a clumsy gal such as myself, who drops things left and right.<br /><br />And more importantly it does its job - keeps the cuticles moist, flexible and minimal and makes my manicure look tidy for a long time. Thankfully, I don't have much going in terms of cuticle growth, but still needed to clean them up once a week give or take. Now after I started using Cuccio Apple Cuticle Remover combined with this oil, I am three weeks in and there's nothing to tend, other than occasionally pushing the cuticles back.<br /><br />The only and really minor detail I am not satisfied with 100% is the applicator. I suppose, if it's intended to be used by multiple people, the dropper is the reasonable and the hygienic option. But for personal use I'd rather have a brush, since that's how I use the dropper anyway. So I'll probably transfer the product into a cuticle pen at some point.

I apply it after my nail polish dries or in the evening while I watch tv. It does a nice job softening my cuticles and the skin around my nails which I like. I apply any excess to my knuckles or the back of my hand and it moisturizes there nicely as well. The smell isn't very strong and is pleasant overall. It is a little messy if you aren't careful and if you don't let it dry or absorb into your skin. You can get oil on your clothes or furniture so make sure to let it set for a bit and wipe any excess off your fingers. I bought a second bottle for a friend and she likes it as well. I'd be willing to buy this again once this bottle runs out. The bottle size is good for the price point and will last you a while depending on how often you apply.,[],B00F644L32,B09GWLJPTH,AG6RDZCQ6KFMAHVIXXGRRLWBS6TQ,2023-06-25 18:42:01.732,0,True

1.0,"this doesn't moisturize, it dries out skin","My skin gets really bad in the winter.  My nails crack, my cuticles peel and bleed, etc., etc.  So I bought this oil hopeful for something that that could address at least the cuticles, hopefully the nails as well.  For some minutes after application, it feels nice; the nail looks glossier and healthier and the cuticle is softened for the time being.  But a day or two after applying it, the skin is as least as dry as before the oil, and the nail I think is even drier to the point where it's splintering and shredding.  There is no lasting benefit to using this oil from what I can tell, and the temporary benefit is outweighed by the damage that starts as soon as it has absorbed.",[],B00F644LTQ,B09GWLJPTH,AFUV7UYK4ACHZHVPRMH7QO7VBBRA,2019-11-23 02:13:03.691,3,True
