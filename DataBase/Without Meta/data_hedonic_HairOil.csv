1.0,It's a WAX!,"Not for caucasin hair!<br />Makes hair dirty stiff. Goes on very wet - so styling takes longer. You burn haor trying to dry this thiick wax. That watery-ness ruined my straight dried hair (that I was about to flat iron).  If using this to flat iron it takes longer = MORE DAMAGE - it's going to take much longer.

5.0,Great Hair Protector,"I’ve tried many brands of heat protectors for my hair over the years. I’ve found a keeper with HSI Professional Argan Oil Thermal Protector. For me most importantly it’s a “color safe” protector. I color my hair, hence important :) The scent is a nice, subtle, not too strong scent of oil. I didn’t think I’d like it at first but after using it the first time once my hair was dry I loved the scent of the oil with my freshly washed hair. This makes my hair feel more moisturized than the others I was using. I straighten my hair out & the drying of my hair is of less time with this product. I let my hair remain damp for about 10 minutes, I spray & brush it through. I then let it sit in my hair for 5 minutes. I want to give the product time to soak into my hair so I get as much protection as possible from the HEAT I’m about to apply. My hair shows no frizz period. The 8 ounce bottle for the price is well worth what I received in return! My picture reflects the spray component. It’s truly the best sprayer I’ve found in a heat protector. It gives good solid sprays. I’ve encountered problems with other sprayers. It’s why I wanted to mention this sprayer tops off what an awesome product HSI makes. This is also Made in the U.S.A. This is definitely worth trying. I’m glad I did & I highly recommend it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1yd84I9mjS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1yd84I9mjS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1yd84I9mjS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AGPC7CWRQPMNQFXWLYJYQYF7DCQA,2021-08-14 01:24:30.577,6,True

Confused, I pointed it at my hand and surely enough, the product leaked out of the nozzle, onto the handle and down my arm. I had to rub it on my hands and run it through my hair, which, I'm sure isn't how it is supposed to be applied, because now my hair and hands feel sticky and hard.

2.0,"curling no, straightening yes, IF you can tolerate the smell","This product works nicely for straightening hair, but fails with a curling iron. My hair quickly and easily holds curls for days, but this product makes hair straighter and prevents the hair from curling properly. Within minutes curls and waves are gone so I would not recommend it for that. The formula is quite wet even spraying from a distance, so you will need to comb it through and give it a few minutes to dry before putting your styling tool on your hair.<br /><br />It does make hair softer, but unfortunately the fragrance is unbearably strong. I used again two days ago and my hair still chokes me with the smell every time it gets near my nose. I could handle it for a little while if the smell dissipated, but not for days. A lot of people have asked what it smells like and have seen some strange answers like baby powder. Not at all. It's more of a sandalwoody/patchouli perfume type smell. Almost resembles a man's cologne. It is certainly not a feminine fragrance. It's like spraying cologne directly on your head.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AHLJGOQ7CNPFCUMTF6XILBEKLSNQ,2019-02-01 16:51:13.167,9,True

The nozzle was faulty at the get go. It sprayed sideways so the spray went everywhere except on my hair! I ended up spraying it into my hands and then rubbing it into my hair. It also dried out my hair and did not help much with the frizz. After using it about 5-6 times I noticed that my ears and the back of my neck developed a rash. Initially I was puzzled about what was happening and then realized that I had started to use this new product. I stopped using it and the rash disappeared. But what I find most offensive about this product is that they advertise it as having Argan Oil and it is listed about half way down in a list of over 50 ingredients!

5.0,Only Heat Protectant I Use! Pics Inside,"I've used the entire bottle, that's how much I really liked my results. My hair is Natural and chemical free so finding a really great heat protectant is extremely important to me to prevent heat damage. I've used this product several times on blow-outs, flexi-rod sets, perm rod sets, magnetic roller sets and with each shampoo, my curls revert back without any damage every time. I wish they would make a larger bottle though. I would definitely be interested in the product even more. I'm inserting a photo of my hair blown out so you can see how it looks with just the heat protectant applied before I applied heat and before I used a flat iron tool. And the 2nd picture is my hair after I shampooed. As you can see from the close up, there was no heat damage. It really works! I would recommend this product to anyone who has naturally curly hair and wishes to straighten their locs without the fear of damaging your curl pattern. Permed hair customers would probably enjoy this product even more than I do because chemically altered hair is already straight. Meaning, they would worry less about stringy ends. I have yet to have a negative experience using this product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wKULYysLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wKULYysLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wKULYysLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZQUDTF2NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZQUDTF2NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZQUDTF2NL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AF52NKIX6WNPYN24SCEZVNXE3BTA,2017-03-06 21:20:25.000,43,True

So this time I read all the good reviews on this product and I just can say that I'm so happy.  First of all, smell so good, even the next day I still can feel the scent, once my hair is completely dry I spray a little bit  over my hair and let it dry for 2 minutes and start with the flat iron, is so easy, and the result is perfect, so shining, very natural.

5.0,Worth the money! Nothing else compares!,"After seeing many positive reviews I decided to purchase HSI argan oil heat protectant for when I flat iron my washed hair(picture included). I first sprayed the product and waited for it onto dry on the left side (picture included) and then flat ironed it and it was okay. Nice, silky and smooth. On the right side (picture included) I decided to spray on the product and not let the product dry and flat ironed it right away. The difference is there! Very shiny, smooth and it made my hair so pretty. Yes it is going to scare you when your hair is wet from the spray and you flat iron it right away because it makes an obvious sizzle sound but any hot surface touching something wet will make that sound. Also a plus is I have a flat iron designed specifically for wet and dry hair. I went back over the left side of my hair with the argan oil spray again and while wet, flat ironed it. Final look (picture included) was beautiful. I have never had any product give me such a light, healthy and beautiful look. It feels light weight and when the wind hits my hair now, my hair blows around like a supermodel, instead of just sitting flat! I love in one of the hottest cities in the USA and your hair will, frizz or curl up from the heat and sweating. I have had my hair done for 3 days and it still looks as beautiful as day 1! I have never had a product that achieved this. Also a plus is that after a few hours of flat ironing my hair with HSI I could still smell my shampoo and can still smell my shampoo on day 3!

5.0,SIMPLY THE BEST OUT THERE!,"I have been using this spray for over a year now and this product has transformed my hair.  I use it daily. I have also told my friends about it! I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />I was trying to find something that would protect my hair from the daily torture of washing, blow drying, flat-iron use, and hairspray.  I have been trying to grow my short hair out for a year, but every two months my stylist would have to cut off any growth I did have due to damage.  I happened to stumble upon this product on Amazon due to it's high ratings.  I started reading the awesome reviews and figured I had nothing to lose.  What I hadn't bargained for is what I had to gain from this purchase!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this styling line!  After reading the reviews, I purchased both the thermal protector spray and the leave in argan oil conditioner (which is an oil).  After the first use, I received compliments about my hair's shiny, smooth texture. I have fairly curly hair that is fine yet thick and frizzy.  This product protects my hair from the blow dryer and flat iron.  I use a Babyliss iron that heats up to 450 degrees to straighten my hair.  I have to do this daily, since the texture of my hair, combined with the hairspray, ensures that daily washing is a must.  I have to tell you that my hair has never looked better.  It is smooth, lays flatter, and stays smooth even in humidity. I actually believe it is contributing to the health of my hair and it has grown more in the last 3 months than I've ever seen.  I use the leave in conditioner (oil) by rubbing a small (dime size) amount through my hair after blow drying.  You can further protect your hair by dipping your fingers in the oil and applying to the sections as you straighten them with a flat iron.  I concentrate on the ends and this has protected my hair beautifully.  I can't say enough about this product, and this line of products.  For people with hair like me, it is the answer to a life long search for something that can tame our hair!  I'm sold!  It's the best product line I've come across in over thirty years of fighting with my hair.  We get along great now!  Try these two products; you will not believe the difference in your hair's texture and sheen!

Well as soon as I got it out the box I spritz a bit (bc let’s face it- scent is important). First thought “baby powder...strong and displeasing.” Husband felt it was ok but for me? The scent made me want to return it. I’m used to salon smelling products. Nice cotton candy smells etc. This smells like I just padded a baby’s bottom with powder. Not good. Next? I sprayed it on and then straightened my hair using my flat iron. Let’s see how it does! It was fairly good. The hair was soft and had shine and it was smooth. I normally have to straighten and then finger thru the hair with a defrizzing cream or other. I only did a shine spray to finish it off and felt that was good enough. So overall? 4 stars. The smell turns me off. I’m not sure I’ll buy again for that reason alone. I may get used to it. First impressions tho.... it did the job. Despite the baby smell.

I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now, but not for what you think.<br /><br />Some information about my hair:<br /><br />I have very fine, white person hair that breaks super easy. On top of that, I just had it colored for the first time in years. So, with that being said, it also has a little chemical damage. Side note: I can only use boar bristle brushes and large tooth combs on my hair...otherwise, BREAKAGE. I also do not use heat on my hair what-so-ever so why the heat protectant?<br /><br />Surprisingly, this was actually an accidental purchase!  I don’t remember how I ended up buying it but there it was sitting on my bathroom counter... and I was like, “ Welp, may as well give it a shot!” I tried blow drying, straightening and curling my hair for the first time in forever ( over a course of a couple of weeks)—just so I could say I tried something new lol. It did well for its purpose but that’s not what I noticed. I had zero flyaways! My hair looked shiny but not oily and most importantly HEALTHY. My breakage is %98 less noticeable ( even my husband thinks so). In the end, I decided I still am not one for using any type of heat on my hair, but this product has turned into a staple for for defrizzing my hair. Works Every. Single. Time.<br /><br />When you get so much breakage you start to try and find things that tame flyaway hair and makes you look less like you rubbed a ballon on your head. I, unfortunately cannot use so many oils and defrizzing products because they end up making my fine hair super oily and weighed down, no matter how much of the product I use.

I use a straightening iron regularly, so anything that promises to help protect my hair from the heat was worth a try. It is difficult to tell if it truly does what it says, as heat damage is a cumulative process. I'll have to leave that analysis to the experts. Meanwhile, I will use this product because it does not gunk up my hair, and if anything, my hair hair feels lighter and silkier after using it. My only issue was with its rather intense, cloyingly sweet scent. Fortunately, that scent calms down once my hair is styled, and my mate assured me that the odor was not too loud. I'm sensitive to strong perfumes, but this scent really doesn't linger for long, at least to the point that I am aware of it, and it doesn't cause me any allergic type reaction.

It leaves my hair super silky, you don't feel the residue or like the hair is weighted down like with some protectors. I flat iron my hair a few times a week and between the high temperatures of the flat iron and the fact that I've been coloring my hair for years I have to take extra care with it. I deal with split ends and breakage already so I really don't want to iron it naked. The thermal protector helps the hair heat more evenly and slowly so that the core of the hair isn't overheated and the ends aren't fried. I love the way it helps my hair shine and it smells Fantastic! This comes in an 8oz  plastic spray bottle. I love mine!<br /><br />I did receive my thermal protectant spray free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product.

I did notice it added softness, a little shine (without being greasy), dries down quickly, and doesn't weigh hair down. It can get a little bit sticky, but really that wasn't the issue. The issue is the scent!!!! The scent of this product is such an overpowering powdery/flowery/spicy baby powder that it's downright nauseating. If you like the scent enough, that might not be an issue. At first, I liked the scent and thought it was nice but WOW does it get old. If you're sensitive to scents, particularly powdery scents, you might want to reconsider. I can smell this well into day 3 hair and develop headaches on first application from its scent. It completely takes away from any and all perfume or lotions you apply - I can't even detect the perfume I sprayed directly into my hair.

5.0,Can't believe I found this!,"I originally bought this product because I was going to start using my curling iron again.  I am 69 yrs old and my hair is....well....old.  It's totally white and extremely fine, wispy and very dry with the ends breaking constantly.  Of course I purchased this product because it's a heat protector and I didn't want to risk drying my hair out more....(Did I tell you I also live in the extremely dry southern Nevada desert?)  I washed and conditioned my hair, towel dried it and sprayed the Aragon oil on my hair.  I used my hair dryer and voila!  The wispy hair was gone and left in its place was smooth very shiny hair.  I think one the greatest things about this heat protector, though, was the fact that it actually increased the volume of my hair!

5.0,AMAZING!!!,"HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil Heat Protector has transformed my GRAY, dry, frizzy, fly-away, dyed and highlighted hair to Soft, Shiny, Smooth, and Bouncy like I had when I was younger, I'm 76. It gives my hair weight but doesn't weigh it down (if you know what I mean about fly-away hair.) My medium-short Bob lasts 5 days; I just brush and spritz a bit of hair spray each day. I wash and condition my hair (I use Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner) towel dry and then apply 8 to 10 sprays of Argan Oil Heat Protector, brush it through my hair and style with a blow dryer and heated straightening brush.

1.0,Leaves a coating on your hair & stinks,"I usually use an argon oil spray/thermal protectant that costs twice as much as I paid for this on a lightening deal, but if I can save some money I am glad to do so. Apparently this is one of those 'you get what you pay for' items.  This sprays out a LOT of product in rather large droplets.  Looks like the nozzle should be adjustable but I couldn't get it to turn. The protector I normally use is a very very fine mist and really easy to control even application. Once I got this in my hair it just left a coating that felt nasty. I do have to say that I did not use a heat element after I put this in my hair so maybe if you are heat styling that would make this better. I rarely heat style my hair and I apply my usual product every am, pm & after every shower with no yukky feel. I will also admit I am particular about fragrances but this smelled so flowery/powdery & was so strong even my husband commented on it.  He did say that after a few hours it had toned down and wasn't so bad but he did ask me to not get in a car with him when I had this on. Bottom line - it might work if you only use it right before heat styling & you don't mind an overpowering fragrance that lasts a long time. - Not for me.<br /><br />**UPDATE** I see that the product page now seems to indicate that the size of the bottle governs the size of the spray. I would have taken that to mean the diameter of the entire spray dispensed, which is logical.  In retrospect, I think they may be trying to inform us of the size of the droplets. I also see that they are indicating this CAN be used as a leave-in conditioner. Either way, it didn't work for me.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AFKKZEGVMQQI7EOA4XWFZ72FO36A,2020-09-23 04:51:22.788,7,True

Lightly spray wet hair before drying or lightly spray dry hair before styling and it provides a protectant sheen to my hair and the frizz is less but not completely resolved.

5.0,Worth the price,"I have curly, very fine hair and this has been great on my hair! I was worried that the spray would go on too thick and leave my hair oily, but the bottle is designed so well. It sprays a very light mist so that you can control how much and how little you put on your hair and a little goes a long way, well worth the price because you only need to use it sparingly. The nozzle also has a lock on it so you never have to worry about it hitting something and spraying. It smells divine and even with just a blow dryer and no straightener my hair looks amazing. I love that I don't have to use my straightener as much because that means less damage on my hair.

5.0,Great product,"Really like the results, my curls look shiny and hair feels soft.  Without the spray the lighter portions of my hair felt and looked like hay.

So I will be doing that.<br /><br />I never ever write bad reviews and I feel terrible doing so, but I wish I never used this.

2.0,Faulty spray,"I bought this item before and I really liked it. I would use it every day, as I was running low, I decided to purchase another one in advance. When I opened the new one, I noticed that they changed the lock mechanism on the sprays. The previous one used a plastic that you can rotate. Now it is a small white button that you push. Anyway, I tried to used it but nothing comes out of the bottle. I thought i just needed to build pressure so I keep spraying and spraying, but still nothing comes out. I opened the bottle to see if something is stuck at the bottom of the straw but it is clear. The sprayer is just faulty. Luckily, I didn't throw away my old bottle yet so I just switched out the spray heads, but if I didn't have that as an option I would be pretty bummed. It would be such a hassle to return it. The product is amazing though, and it smells amazing, it kind of volumizes my hair a little bit too. I would give it 5 stars if my bottle worked, but a faulty spray head is kind of a deal breaker since without it you would have to lather the product onto your hair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-tFSFQqYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-tFSFQqYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-tFSFQqYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jh2m1BEdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jh2m1BEdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jh2m1BEdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AE3KAKXLQ7IC6WQZUA2XCVK3YSDA,2021-01-25 02:16:56.972,1,True

1.0,New formula sucks,"I had a sterling review here, had to take it down because unfortunately that is no longer my experience. Ever since HSI changed this from the red bottle to the white bottle it seems that the formula has changed as well and this white bottle version no longer works to make my hair sleek, shiny and bouncy and smell nice as it did before. Very disappointing because the results before were amazing and I encouraged a lot of friends to try it and couldnt stop raving about it, but now it leaves my hair dull, no longer as polished and sleek as it used too, have to use so much more product and doesnt last as long, where as before I could go a few weeks looking like I freshly ironed it, now its frizzy in a day or two. Also I bought the top 5 version that is also on the listing, complete garbage. None of those oil‘s are present, they are at the end of a long ingredients list of junk, feels like you’re spraying your hair with just water. And it’s not even an HSI product, why is listed on the same page then? Upset to be tricked into purchasing and wish I could return for a refund. Need to find a new thermal protector, can’t rely on this one anymore, heartbroken that this one is no longer performing.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AH4PM4QR6CQM3V7LTEDDKNWBQDMQ,2016-09-08 18:55:58.000,5,True

2.0,Too greasy and crunchy for non-fine but not coarse hair,"I am a South Asian woman with thick, wavy hair that isn't fine, coarse, fluffy, oily, or textured. Ever since dyeing it though, it is prone to some dryness. I really wanted to love this, as I put a few drops of argan oil through my damp hair before my heat protectant for the past few weeks and loved the results (my ends don't get dry by the next time my roots get oily and need to be washed). I hated the smell of my old heat protectant though (tresseme). I thought this would simplify my post shower hair process and be a healthier and better smelling alternative to my previous heat protectant. Unfortunately, no matter what I do, I just can't get this heat protectant to work for me. Even if I use very little (not good coverage wise for heat protection), it makes my hair stringy and oily. I think it may very well be a good product, but a good product for textured or curly hair only, and it isn't marketed as such. Two stars just because it won't work for large swaths of hair types and still provide adequate heat coverage (if you ""make it work"" by using very little of it).",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AE2GHHSUIPN4HF4FDALNTCZXY3DA,2021-03-09 02:11:29.159,0,True

5.0,Love this heat protection spray,"I have been using this thermal spray for past 3 months and I can be more satisfied. This spray is amazing - protects well from heat and hydrates hair so well that the result is smooth frizz free hair. I use it everyday before I blow dry or use hot iron. The best part is that it does not weigh my hair down or leave any sticky residue (which is a big deal since I have very thin wavy hair). Love it, love it, love it. I would definitely buy from the same buyer again. Since it arrived in time and in great condition.

1.0,One Star (updated review),"[[VIDEOID:1c94fc552484056ce34fcfdc52071507]] Smells horrible and feels weighted in your hair.<br /><br />Update- 1/16/19<br />The company reached out to me because of my 1 star review. They are under new management and trying to fix past mistakes. I LOVE that they reached out to me and tried to make things right! They reformulated their product and wanted to send me a free one to try again. However, it was a bit heavy-handed saying if we send you a new product you’ll take the bad review down. Nope, if your new product is good THEN I’ll take the bad review down. I received the new product yesterday with a nice note (again asking me to take the review down).<br />Here’s the kicker- I can’t actually use it because the spray head is broken and doesn’t connect to the tube. Either their extreme and unnecessary plastic shrink wrap broke the pump on transit, or the materials they are using are just substandard. Because they were so nice, I actually sent them a video of the broken spray head.<br />Also, I opened the bottle and the product has a sweet chemically smell. Kinda like sugary Aqua Net.<br />Better customer service, but I can’t say if the product is worth the money or not.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AFQONVUIRRYCCXGGU5G7OGRRDBBQ,2016-05-07 15:58:28.000,0,True

3.0,"Initially didn't like, but it's getting better...","Moderate success as a hair straightener.  This is like scented water and evaporates quickly like water.  I had to go over each section multiple times to pull my curls out, oftentimes observing several minutes later a section that was previously straight curling up again.  After a while of working on my hair section by section, I went back to my heavier oil based straightening spray.  I ended up spending almost twice the time straightening.<br /><br />I used a moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner, gentle blow dry on cool setting, used a 450 degree straightening iron.  I have medium weight hair with curly sections, wavy sections, and straight sections.  I well know how to do this and with this spray I had to work harder, longer, and still had some wavy hair at the end.  One should not go over and over hair with high heat like this.<br /><br />The single plus for this product was my hair looked shiny and lighter colored from not being weighed down with oils.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/08/2016:  I'm upgrading this product one star because I realized that my experiment with this new straightener was incomplete.  I had only just started using the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (something I had not previously done) because my hair has changed as I have gotten older.  I also added spraying down my hair while damp with the HSI and then again after it was dry and ready to use as a straightener.  After several days of the above, washing and conditioning with a moisturizing product, applying the HSI liberally to damp hair (even on days I don't straighten it), blow drying on cool, and then reapplying the HSI during straightening, I'm getting better results.  The heavier oil based spray still seems superior and I'm focusing that on the ends with the HSI on the remainder of the length.  It's a somewhat tedious process BUT my hair appears cleaner, feels lighter from a weight standpoint, and &#34;moves&#34; better, much like I imagine naturally straight hair does with no product in it.  It is quite possible this is simply a moisturizing issue with my own hair and as its condition improves, so does the response to this lightweight product.<br /><br />I'll continue experimenting.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AGVGZFNOQ2AYANUJHQZKGPZERNUQ,2016-02-03 18:52:38.000,1,True

It will help with the frizz. I can’t get over how great it smells.<br />The other compliment I’ve gotten a few times is that it looks like I dyed my hair.

5.0,"If it works on my hair, it will work on yours!","Recently began to straighten my hair and was frying it by applying too much heat.  My hairdresser sold me an expensive salon product that was supposed to protect my hair from the heat.  It left my hair limp and oily.  I tried several drugstore brands with the same result.  I decided to take a chance with HSI when I saw it on Amazon.  I have very fine, shoulder-length, colored and highlighted hair.  I have found my forever daily product!  Not only has my hair stopped looking fried, this thermal protector also seems to keep the color from fading as quickly.  I wash and condition my hair, spray on the thermal protector, and comb it through.  I leave it wet while I apply my makeup and then blow dry and straighten.  My hair is shiny and healthy-looking and not limp or oily in the least!  Even if I decide to go back to shorter hair and stop using the flat iron, I will still always use this product to prevent damage from the blow dryer.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AEMYGQJCAQSKDSYTXXQCDA5PHEUQ,2015-08-19 21:59:40.000,4,True

5.0,Makes average looking hair look great and makes great hair look fantastic,"I initially bought this producy to protect my hair from the heat of my flat iron (I am a 36 y/o white male with wavy and somewhat thick mid-length hair).<br /><br />While the product does seem to do what's on the tin (protect from the heat of flat irons and blow dryers), I have found it to serve an even better purpose as a styling agent.<br /><br />The two best use cases are as follows:<br /><br />Apply it to damp hair out the shower, after shampooing and conditioning, followed up by a blow dry. Without applying the oil, my hair often looks dry, frizzes in areas, and lays flat. With the oil, my hair looks almost like it was salon-finished. It looks shiny (without being greasy), healthy, and voluminous.<br /><br />The second best use for this product is to apply it after waking up when I don't have time to shower. Frequently after waking up, my hair just lays the wrong way and combing it doesn't help. What I'll do is to run the faucet with warm water, splash the water onto my hair to get it damp again, apply the argan oil, comb, and blow dry. The end result looks about 85% as good as applying it out the shower and is a 100% improvement over my bed head.<br /><br />As others have written, I would not recommend applying this product to dry hair as it will weigh your hair down and can look greasy. This product seems to lock in moisture so is best applied to damp hair. Upon initial application it can feel a bit sticky. But as it dries, the stickiness fades completely.<br /><br />This is overall my favorite hair product as it addresses pretty much every issue I have with with my hair, from frizziness and flatness to lack of volume and dryness. It accomplishes all this WITHOUT leaving a greasy finish, and it smells pretty good to boot. Sadly Amazon is frequently out of stock lately but it's worth snagging when you can.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AERAZXUCQPZ3S2TS5VXMMOENYMMQ,2023-01-30 17:28:58.146,10,True

It's not an automatically unpleasant scent, but I did notice it hours after I put it in and it was so overpowering I was considering washing my freshly straightened hair. I could only use it once before I gave it to my friend who said they scent did not bother her.<br />2. It's moisturizing all right. Moisturizing to the point of making freshly washed hair look like an oil slick. I was not impressed with the way my hair looked after using it, and I have lots and lots of hair oil products I could use if I was looking for that look.<br />3. I don't really even feel like it protected my hair. I guess there's no real way to tell from one use but it felt more like I was deep fat frying than effortlessly gliding over protection product.<br /><br />This stuff was a real miss for me.

I am someone who likes my hair to look its best every single day, though, so I tend to use too much heat on my hair. I have cut down on washes in the shower for my hair, but also added this product in for protecting my hair when I do dry it. I had invested in a CHI product prior to this and I can say it did nothing to protect my hair against the heat. I have the leave in conditioner from this brand, so I went for this and it works so well. Put it in your damp hair, making sure it's covering the majority of your hair, and go for it. (If you're trying to protect your hair from the heat also try letting it air dry for a bit more and use your hairblower on a medium heat level when you can.) If you want to add some shine to your hair spray a small amount of this on your dry hair, blow dry your hair on a lower heat for a moment just to dry the product without ruining the way your hair looks and go.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AHVALRN7OG35II7JXNNMFIG35ZIA,2019-08-27 17:27:53.217,19,True

3.0,Meh. . .,"As with most of these heat protectors, there is not instruction as to whether to use this before or after your styling product.  Did I notice a big difference in drying time?  No, not particularly.  I think your dryer has a greater impact on that than anything else.  I also felt this brand smelled of alcohol.  Not sure if that's any ingredient, but if it does contain a version of alcohol, that would seem to contradict the protective quality of the product--again, I have not verified this.<br /><br />My stylist prefers using heat protectant products before applying the direct heat of irons, so that's how I'm going to utilize from now on.

I haven't used anything else since then.  You have to really overdue it to get your hair oily with this particular argan oil.

Especially because you can always add more if you did not receive the desired affect.  It's awesome and it has a pleasant smell.

5.0,BEST. EVER.,"I was curious to see what all the positive ratings were about with this product as I thought it would be good but not miraculously great.  Well, it's miraculously great! This thermal protector helped restore and protect my very dry, damaged hair from the daily curling/straightening and blow drying I was doing.  The smell is pleasant and not overpowering or perfumey.  The spray nozzle disperses the product very well into a fine mist.  The extra bonus with the nozzle is it's travel friendly thanks to the small white button you push (which goes in or out) to engage/disengage your pump, so you don't get accidentally spray/leak this product in your luggage.  It adds a nice sheen to my hair which doesn't make it oily or sticky to the touch. You get a lot for what you pay for and the bottle will last you several months.  My hair feels so very silky and smooth after using this product.

I restyled the next day, did not add more product since I worried I added too much already and while the body of my hair looked good, it now felt like I needed to wash the hair closer to my scalp. 2 days in a row, for different reasons, my hair felt like it had uneven amounts of product.

It even leaves my hair feeling super soft and not weighed down at all. The one major issue I have with this product is the scent. I can't even really describe it but it's like.....baby power mixed with musk. Some people like that scent but I prefer more fresh/floral scents and this is not it. I've seen people comment that the scent doesn't linger, but it does on my hair. God forbid I get the spray on my bathroom counter tops, then my bathroom smells like it. It really is unfortunate because it's the best product Iv'e owned as far as the heat protectors is concerned but the smell is so foul...I can't take it.

When I spray it goes everywhere on the floor in a fine mist and it’s very slippery and hard to clean.<br /><br />I use it with the 24k hair drying brush that is all the rave. It looks like I have a salon blowout whenever I do my hair.<br /><br />This weekend my Latina friend was in from out of town and she has very very very thick hair that’s naturally big curls.

5.0,Going natural at 60! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!,"I rarely write reviews, although many items I’ve purchased on Amazon deserve a great review.<br />I just turned 60 and decided to let my hair go natural. I have a sister-in-law that always does a BEAUTIFUL color for me and I get a lot of compliments. But, platinum is “IN” and I knew my hair was whitish platinum and I wanted to do something different. Thank the good Lord I don’t look my age because growing it out sometimes makes me feel “old”. You know like years ago you’d see your grandmother or aunt going gray!! LOL<br />I did quite a lot of research, as well as discussions with Sis-n-law and the biggest con was DRYNESS. I have thin hair, especially now not coloring it and wavy and FRIZZY when it’s humid, rains, I’m sweating, I walk outside, (ugh) so suffice it to say a lot of time, especially from April - October. And now, there are no words with growing it out. All I’d like is for my hair to have a little volume, body soft and smooth. You know, just like in ALL the photos I see of women my age who are graying.<br />I read reviews on this product and specifically looked for anyone with my issues.<br />I am overjoyed by the end result!!!! As you will see in my photos, my hair looks beautiful, to me, anyway. I do use a smoothing shampoo and moisturizing shampoo and conditioner I combine and when drying, a small amount of mousse and smoothing oil ... (today ADDED this product) while wet, dry it on high heat but medium and large round brush. The pics are the end result. Soft, smooth, some body and volume. All exactly as I’d hoped. (I still don’t look like the gals in the magazines!!) but I do love the way it looks and feels. Idk how well it’ll hold up when it gets humid, but I live in the Boston area, so the weather is beginning to change.<br />I am extremely happy with this product and i hope my review helps someone who is dealing with the same. We’re all individuals, so it’s all trial and error.

2.0,Leaves a weird film on hair and has a weird smell.,"I want to start off by saying I usually never leave reviews, but I hate the way this product leaves my hair (smell and texture wise) and I was shocked due to all the great reviews! I’m not too sure if it’s actually doing a great job of protecting my hair from heat because I haven’t had the product for long enough to see a difference, but what drives me crazy after using this spray is how my hair feels and smells. I thought the first time I used it I had put maybe too much of the product in because you could feel this sort of dry, film on my hair after I had sprayed the product on my wet hair and blow dried it. Next time I put it on my wet hair I only used a little bit, but once again when my hair was completely dry it had this film and my hair felt SUPER dry. I thought okay maybe I’ll just spray it only on dry hair, but honestly spraying it on dry hair before using my flat iron or blow dryer made the film and dryness even more noticeable. Also, I never spray too much on my roots, but after I use this spray my hair is completely dry and almost looks greasy on top! It is so stiff too, I feel like I can’t really run my hands through my roots. I’ve also noticed that my hair takes longer to dry and I usually end having to go over my hair with the hair dryer longer than I normally would because it just will not dry (usually my roots, so this is why I try to avoid spraying them). Another thing that drives me crazy is the smell of this. The smell is really pungent and chemically, I usually love the way most hair products smell but I hate this one. Overall, like I said earlier I’m not too sure about the actual part of the heat protectant because I haven’t used it long enough to see any results, but the film, dryness, and smell is god awful and if you hate feeling a film in your hair, need some good moisture from a product, and don’t like a chemical smell, then I’d stay far away from this and try a different protectant.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AFBGCPOPJCFUDBLZZHCMRY4JC3FA,2021-10-12 20:20:32.486,1,True

I love the products they sent, and I would definitely recommend this product to people. They have great products, and have shown they will now be providing excellent customer service!!<br /><br />Once I received a functional product I loved it! It took three tries at ordering this before I received something I could use. The first order was damaged. The pump was broken so I had to return the product. The second time I ordered it never showed up. When I looked at my order on Amazon it showed the scheduled delivery day. The day came and went with no product. When I looked to see where the product was I got a ""it's lost, sorry"" message. I decided to go with three strikes and you're out, so there was one more shot. The third try I got the product, and I absolute love it! It seems to help my hair and I love the smell. Honestly though, I had such a ridiculous experience trying to order and get what I wanted, that I'm not sure as if I would order again to avoid anymore issues like that. For the actual product, I highly recommend! It is great!  Update: I got an email from the company asking how I like the product. I told them my story and they offered to send me a free product for my troubles in exchange for a 5 star review. I said okay because I was impressed by the follow up and offer to make it better. I never received the free product. I don’t feel right about the situation, and I feel like they were just saying something to get a higher review without worrying about making things right. I will NEVER order this product again because I just don’t feel right about the company!",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AG7EDGXOS7ZODLB5XMOILVAALXZQ,2018-10-23 17:43:58.631,18,True

I had already threw the first bottle away. So now I have a bottle that I cannot use and had to go buy a spray bottle to dump the oil in so I can use it.  other than that it is a wonderful product.

4.0,"Not for me, but works for fam'!","Originally I was going to give this product a 2 star review because it does promote proper use for ALL hair types, which I do believe is a bit false. I personally have really thick, natural hair and it actually made my hair feel a bit brittle the two times I did use it, but my mom and grandmother actually use it and they LOVE this stuff. So thankfully, it doesn't go shelved as a useless product. Both my family members have processed/relaxed hair and they're FULLY straight hair really take up to this product.<br /><br />It amazes me, their hair doesn't frizz up even when they sweat and their strands like shiner and healthier than they ever have before! Their hair is ALSO much softer to the touch too, even when they wrap it at night (usually the setting foam makes their hair hard, but not lately since we had this). I think this probably works better for people who have had some kind of hair treatment or maybe have a straighter texture.<br /><br />I'll purchase this again, but primarily for my family so I thank you for this!

After blow drying my ends were still dry and bushy. After flat iron ends became sort of crunchy. I tried it a second time using either less or more of the product. Still under-welmed. Now that I see other poor reviews for this product, some people even claiming hair damage (which I can believe). I will not continue to try to like of incorporate this ""thermal protector"" in my hair care regimen.

It’s like a soapy water consistency, I actually was able to apply a generous amount of it on my hair, without weighing my hair down or making it look “greasy”. I literally only used this product and no leave in conditioner or anything else when straightening and curling my very naturally kinky curly hair, and it left my hair shiny, silky straight, not stiff or dry.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31kb4AY6BSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31kb4AY6BSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31kb4AY6BSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu9gkICUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu9gkICUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vu9gkICUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AG3QYDWVVC6EHSMWWPKFVQF2GKJA,2018-05-08 16:00:05.486,3,True

With his many allergies and it being the time of year that the weather changes, we dismissed the sickness as his ""usual,"" since he gets sick so often despite many of these symptoms being Celiac-like. Well, looking back, it all started when I began using this gluten-containing spray. He touches my hair, sleeps on the same sheets, etc--all the ""perfect recipe"" to become sick from gluten. While not a serious reaction (those land him in the hospital), it has been enough to make him feel pretty bad the last few weeks.

Having fine hair makes it hard to find products that don't make it super oily. Also also living in Texas makes it super easy for it to be frizzy. I usually have to run my straightener through my hair after blow drying it. That is not the case with this. Granted it smells a little bit like baby powder but not too bad though. OVERALL...

5.0,I Love This Stuff!,"I had dreamed of having long straight hair all my life.  Unfortunately, I have very dry, frizzy, thick hair.  The first time my stylist used a flat iron I was thrilled.  I had long, shiny, sleek hair!  ""Will I be able to do this,"" I asked.  She assured me that I could and showed me what to do to get the best results.  Then it was my turn.  Well, it was sort of straight, but it was far from shiny and sleek and the fizz reappeared in about an hour.  My stylist said that I just needed to practice with the flat iron.  Three months later I was still saying, ""Show me how to use the flat iron again.  I must be doing something wrong.""  Then I discovered the HSI line of products with argon oil.  I had been using the shampoo and conditioner for about two months when my stylist asked me if I had been doing something different with my hair and noted that it looked really healthy.<br />I liked the shampoo and conditioner so much that I decided to try the oil heat protector and that's when I declared, ""I love this stuff!""  My hair was long, shiny and sleek, and stayed that way.  Eureka!<br />I highly recommend the full line of HSI Professional products.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AEDATT5LHNTBX7MWGUWJVOUMOVWQ,2019-09-28 04:15:16.635,1,True

I was desperate. I put a homemade hair mask on my hair, tried leaving my conditioner on a bit longer before doing a cold water rinse for a week, switched my shampoo/conditioning technique up a bit... and had minimal results. Got this just to protect my hair so I can preserve as much as possible until I’m able to get to a salon. At least that way I could curl my hair. After the first use, my hair felt so much softer and shinier. Last night I detangled my hair, sprayed an ample amount of product on my hair, combed it through and braided my hair. I woke up, sprayed a little more on before flat ironing my hair and my hair doesn’t feel dry at all anymore. I’ve only had this for 3 days!<br /><br />I am absolutely obsessed with this product and it is extremely affordable! 10/10 recommended. I am really picky about my hair products and I am blown away.

5.0,"thumbs up, will likely repurchase","Definitely makes my hair soft and shiny.  I used quite a few sprays on the ends and throughout my hair after showering.  For me, applying on wet hair is much better than dry hair.  On dry hair, it makes my hair too greasy BUT....my wet hair loved the oil and soaked it up.  The product worked nicely with my blow dryer and brush after drying my hair a little bit before styling.  Definitely kept the flyaways and frizz down.  I applied an extra spray or two in areas that I know are particularly dry.  I have only tried it once so far and was impressed.  My hair tends to be difficult to comb out of the shower so this makes detangling it much easier out of the shower.  I don't usually brush my hair wet unless I have a detangling product and this did the job nicely for that too.<br /><br /> I did not use any other styling products with this... but I imagine using a straightening product as well would work nicely too.  I usually use a combination of a straightening product and actual argan oil.  This is why I purchased this product because I have been using argan oil for years to nourish my hair, especially BEFORE styling on wet hair.  Since my hair is super dry, I may still end up adding oil on top of this too.  I usually add oil to my hair on a daily basis on the ends.  So this just means I need to use a little less than what I usually do.  This product did a good job and I did NOT have to use a flat iron afterwards at all.  A little bit of hairspray and oil keeps the flyaways down with no need to flat iron.  I try not to flat iron unless I have a special occasion so I don't damage my hair.  This will be a GREAT daily product to use right out of the shower.<br /><br />Also, I LOVE the spray bottle itself.  It sprays out just the right amount and nicely distributes the product.  Will keep the bottle for use later if I make my own mixture of something! haha!",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AGAMJBXVL4DW6MIIB7K7SJUGBALQ,2020-01-28 03:31:29.420,0,True
5.0,You NEED this,"I write reviews very seldom but I had to come back for this. I originally bought this in 2020 when I learned about heat protection importance.<br />I ran out and thought I would try Chi brand since everyone raves about their straighteners.<br />The Chi brand was so heavy, smelled odd and didn’t take down any drying time. The HSI brand is the BEST! Cuts dying time in half, protects my hair and keeps it soft all day. I always have major frizz so I can’t speak to that. It only tamed it in the beginning but as the day goes on it gets frizzy- I don’t blame the product for that. Either way- GET THIS.<br />For reference I have medium/long dyed blonde hair that’s extremely thick. It’s wavy in texture.

I’d use it if not this... Smells like grandma’s old makeup bag, so if you don’t like powdery fragrances or the smell of baby powder, skip this.<br />But overall it is not a bad product, it does make the hair feel softer and makes the whole blow drying & straightening job a lot easier. Brush bristles just glide through, without tangling. It doesn’t add any shine to my hair, I assume that’s because my hair is very porous and dry.

I was cheering in London’s New Years Day parade so I needed something really strong to keep my curled hair intact and make my hair look healthy. Since then I’ve used it ever since and I won’t be going back to my old heat protectants. I honestly have no clue how it’s so good but I will use it, curl my hair, and then not have to use hair spray and my curls will stay through the entirety of me cheering and jumping around and even to the next day. Before my curls would fall an hour or 2 after and that was with tons of hairspray. This has changed my life.

I spray this Argan Oil Heat protector after I wash my hair when is still damp or when is dry, and I notice that immediately helps seal my ends and my hair looks less frizzy. After my hair dries it feels so smooth and looks healthier. So I like to use it after I wash my hair and also when I'm going to style it with the hot iron.

4.0,"Works well, not a fan of the smell.","Whenever I get a new product I have a habit of putting it on my hands.  Is this normal?  I dunno but this stuff made the hand I put it on considerably softer and smoother  than the other, without any sticky residue.<br /><br />I’ve used it on my hair once so far.  It holds up well to heat and I feel that my hair is protected.  That said, the smell isn’t awesome.  It’s not necessarily bad but I’m just not a fan.  It smells like straight up baby powder.  I have pretty long full hair so it’s always brushing up against my face and that’s all I can smell.  I’d much rather an unscented option or something sweeter.

5.0,This is a magic potion,"Although I rely heavily on product reviews, I tend to not leave them myself (hypocritical, I know). But I have to chime in with my opinion on this heat protector spray - it's unbelievable and worth more than 5 stars. No joke.<br /><br />I have super thick, part wavy/curly part straight hair, so I have flat ironed consistently for years - even on days I go wavy my hair is so thick I use a flat iron to ""debulk"".  Even on morning when I don't wash my hair, I have to flat iron at least the part by the nape of my neck and behind ears, which seem to curl/frizz while I sleep. Basically, I use heat tools every day.<br /><br />With years of heat use, aging hair, and recent coloring my hair has been dull with a ton of breakage and damage so I motivated to get a protectant spray. It's light, not stiff or sticky - I hate the feel of product in my hair so I'm sensitive to that. Feels like nothing once dry. It smells fine - not amazing like some other products (Rusk). There is a sizzle (but no steam/smoke) with the flat iron when not fully wet, but I think that's physics. Hair looks about the same afterwards - not super sleek and shiny or anything. Helps against frizz/waving in high humidity very well.<br /><br />So where's the magic here? THE NEXT DAY. This product keeps the smooth, no frizz style until washed out. For the first time in I don't know how many years I don't have to touch a heat tool when I wake up - my hair looked the same as it did the day before. Even underneath in the sweaty-prone nape of neck/temple areas. I can't get over it. Once I even went 2 days without washing hair just to test it - even after a second night of sleeping it holds up.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that I didn't discover this years ago - I can't imagine how much time I would have saved by waking up, quickly brushing hair, and going about my day. And decreasing the frequency of flat ironing must be better for hair too, so it's a win-win.  I haven't used this product with a curling iron so I can't speak to whether it would work similarly, but if you want protection from heat tools and straight hair until you shampoo next, BUY THIS.",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AHARJL6THA4SP6ZUMOK7ENK7PI4Q,2020-09-14 16:13:16.697,19,True

4.0,Great heat styling product!,"This is a great product. I use this in combination with coconut oil when I straighten my hair and it is so shiny and healthy looking afterwards. My hair isn't in the greatest shape right now due to bleaching, but I'm in the process of getting it healthy again and I think this product is a big help. It's also good at keeping frizz at bay.<br /> For me there are 2 downsides to this product, but definitely not deal breakers! 1) is the smell...it isn't pleasant at all in my opinion and 2) is the type of spray nozzle it comes with. The mist is great and coats hair evenly, but it's one of those sprayers that covers a large area at once and as soon as I spray it, the particles find there way to my nose making me sneeze or just irritating my nose in general. I thought this was weird, because I've never encountered this while spraying a hair product into my hair! However, the nozzle does function very easily and smoothly which is a big plus.<br />So, are these reasons not to buy this awesome spray?....no not at all. Just thought it was worth mentioning for those who may be sensitive to such things. I definitely recommend this spray to add shine and a healthy overall appearance to your hair! For those of you wondering about the benefits of the coconut oil I mentioned above....coat your hair and scalp in the oil and let sit for at least 30 minutes(longer is good too!). Wash your hair as usual, avoiding getting shampoo on the ends. This will leave a slight coating of oil in those areas to add moisture to your hair and make it look shiny after styling.

Which leads to split ends and frizzy hair.<br />HSI Professional Argan Oil Thermal Protector spritzed onto my towel dried hair before styling has added a shine and silky feel to my hair that I haven’t had in quite some time.<br />The Argan Oil Thermal Protector will quickly become your hair’s saving grace, whether it’s hair extensions or your own natural hair.<br />Spritz it generously from roots to tip before your styling session and then proceed without worrying about daily heat damage with the shielded thermal protection of argan oil thermal protector against intense heat and will help keep your hair frizz-free and hydrated AND help cut your hairstyling time; and who couldn’t use a few extra minutes everyday for say an extra cuppa coffee before you face the day.<br />The Argan Oil scent is very light and by the time I was finished styling my hair I couldn't smell is at all. Yes, I would recommend to my family and friends.  ~LeahSay's Views<br />I received HSI Professional Argan Oil Thermal Protector to facilitate a review.*",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AG3MGLIY7HQUQ3ZRGQXCJRQQCVIQ,2016-09-08 20:45:35.000,0,False

5.0,Beautiful All Around. (from scent to look),"When I first opened the package the HSI Professional Thermal 450° came in, the first thing I noticed was the scent. It smells amazing! It isn't a heavy scent, but a light beautiful fragrance.  When I pulled the bottle out of the packaging it came in, I noticed the bottle was in a plastic seal. However, the plastic seal was semi-broken. The bottle leaked a little in the packaging, leaving the bottle a bit oily. It must have leaked in transition.  It was a little messy, but an easy clean up.<br /><br />The thermal protector 450°, does what it says in the name, Protects against heat damage. It can also be used on natural hair and hair extensions. So all the ladies and men can keep their hair silky, smooth, healthy and frizz-free. Which is a huge plus for me!<br /><br />You can use it before you use any heat appliance,  like a flat iron, hair dryer, or curling iron/wand. Which is awesome, cause who likes spilt ends? So why not prevent split ends and keep our hair healthy and beautiful with HSI Professional Thermal Protector 450°?<br /><br />It love using it on my hair.

4.0,Worth every cent!,"This stuff is fantastic! I use it every time I curl or straighten my hair. About a year ago I got highlights which left my hair COMPLETELY damaged so I decided to try this after reading all the amazing reviews. This thermal protector leaves my hair silky and smooth and completely hides the damage that was caused, plus I think its actually making my hair more healthy with every use. Also, it doesn't make my hair feel tacky or greasy like other sprays. Totally worth the buy!!!! The only downside I've found with it is the mist is very fine which is great except when you're in a small bathroom and inhale the mist. Now I just do a few spritz then take a break and finish it off. Still very much worth it.

5.0,My new Go-To styling product,"I read all the reviews and this was the one I went with. I don't usually put anything in my hair except for maybe a few drops of Argan oil but I was worried I needed a little more protection once I started using my straightener again.  This one does the job perfectly.  Not very heavy, I have very thin hair so you would notice right away if it was heavy, or greasy.  Now I even use it as an all over almost conditioning even if I don't straighten my hair.  Love how it makes my hair feel nice and manageable, my hair has tendency to tangle at the ends because it's damaged as well.  The smell is light and pleasant, took some getting used to but I like it.  Some people may not like the &#34;oil&#34; smell but I dig it.  I will order this product again definitely.

5.0,"My incredible dry hair, so incredible that even seeing it, I still cant believe it. Please protect and take care of your hair","I will start by saying that I have my hair terrible damaged and of course, very, sadly dry.<br />Number one: this product smells very good, something I really appreciate, thanks HSI. I like the packaging of the product, easy to take with your hand and spry the product on your hair, however, sometimes I like to put some product on my hand (not opening the bottle, but sprying it in my hand like when you retain water) so I can have more accurate product on my prefer hair sections. After applying the product on my hair with my hands I wash and dry my hands completely with a towel (for security reasons since then I will use my iron or my curling iron) also to avoid leaving any residues on my hands, since this is a product with chemicals. This product gives shine, not as much as I will like to, but this is because of my incredible dry hair (I didnt take care of my hair years back :( ). It does protect hair, and I can tell for sure: if I use the iron without the product (my hair looks inmmediately even more dry. So please, do your self a favor: If you are young or whatever, please take care of your hair always, everyday shampoo is terrible, and hairdryer/iron/curling iron more than 2 times a week is deadly for the hair. In the begining year after year you see no change or you get new hair growing and old dry hair leaving with the haircuts but so many years later you are going to see a terrible difference), and if I use the iron and the product it will not look dry, it looks with shine. The product is like white colored water.

5.0,This does wonders on my hair!,Do you straighten your hair a lot? Or just blow dry it everyday because you have no time to let it air dry but you dislike the fact you're damaging your hair? I felt that way too but after buying this heat protectant I changed my mind! My hair feels incredibly soft and smooth when I put a few sprays of this heat protectant in my hair and then blow dry it. It's stopped my hair from getting split ends. When I straighten or curl my hair you could see a great amount of shine in my hair without it looking greasy. It looks better than ever. This is honestly the best heat protectant I've ever used on my hair. It's a little bit pricey but it's definitely worth it! I rather pay a greater price for a heat protectant that will actually do what it's suppose to do than buy a cheap one that only makes my hair worse!

1.0,"wSticky, greasy, fried crispy... And it's not chicken?","I have tried to successfully use this product several times since I purchased it 5 months ago, but every time I get the same results: sticky feeling, greasy looking hair, which is bad enough that I actually need to wash it after trying to use this. It does not work as a heat protectant. It fried the drier ends in my hair, I had to cut them off just now. My hair smelled burnt. I straighten my hair every time I wash it and I usually use a different product for protection, my hair is very healthy and is bleached very light, but this product ruins my hair.<br />It smells OK when you are spraying it on, but once you apply heat it smells gross.<br /><br />There is no amount of refund that will un fry my hair, luckily I only had to cut off half an inch.<br /><br />I do not recommend anyone try this product just because the majority of reviews are good. I take extremely good care of my hair and I am well educated in this area: there is absolutely no reason for these things to happen with a protectant spray. This is going in the trash.<br /><br />I use a CHI flat iron, and usually use Regis products and a little bit of argan oil mixed in a serum for heat protection... I am really upset I got lazy enough to try to use this HSI stuff again instead of go get my regular product. I am in the process of growing a pixie out, and losing half an inch of length was really painful for me, I cannot imagine how much worse it could be for someone else though.<br /><br />*Update*<br />Returned product & recieved refund.

I have very fine highlighted (damaged) frizzy hair, and I use blow dryers and/or heat products daily.  At first, I thought this product was too heavy for my hair.  I would spray it on damp hair and then blow dry.  For me, it works much better with direct heat than blow drying with medium/cool air.  When I use heat tools I can sometimes see steam/smoke which I assume is the product protecting my hair.  Once this is done there is zero heavyness left in my hair, it is just smooth and shiny and not at all greasy.  For me, this effect holds 90% to the next day.  I have also had success with this product as a second-day refresher when my hair is kinked from an updo or curly.  I use this product on the middle to ends (not my roots) and then use heat.<br /><br />As others have said, I like to use this product by spraying into my hands and then applying to hair rather than spraying directly onto hair, however this could be just because I do not have the best aim! ;-)",[],B00LMIVLXY,B00LMIVLXY,AGA44IUUWMFRJJB4GMOWGX5AV7VQ,2016-02-16 15:49:01.000,2,True

5.0,Makes hair look beautiful and more manageable!,"Got this product as part of my Christmas gift. I added it to my wish list due to all the great reviews. I have to say that I've had hair issues since I can consciously remember and have tried product after product. I have a lot of hair, and it's frizzy, which has led me to use a straightener every day of my life since middle school. So far, I have definitely noticed  a difference in my hair. I would say the product certainly does what it says. I normally use it after I shower on wet or damp hair. I then blow dry and straighten it. Definitely makes my hair feel smoother, shiny, no frizz and faster to flat iron. It doesn't weigh my hair down and there is no icky residue like all the other products I've used. Other products leave my hair feeling weighed down or just gross to put my hands through. I have like 10 bottles of unused hair products that have promised the same things and let me down. I'm pleasantly surprised that this product won't end up like the others. Will definitely purchase more.

I can't find a way to describe it but I personally love the way it smells. Smell is subjective though so I can see others not liking it. It also is really strong. The smell lingers in my hair throughout the day. At the end of the day, if I put my hair to my nose I can still smell the scent faintly. That doesn't bother me at all though.

Why would i want to put a water based product on my hair right before i straighten it?  It defeats the purpose and adds to the dreaded frizziness that you can't get rid of when you have a bad straightening session.  You know, the times your hair ends up looking like the end of a broom after a poor execution of trying to straighten it.  This happened to my hair whenever i used this heat protectant.  Not to mention the smell of baby powder does not add to the way I would like my hair to smell as the finished result.  I will definitely look up the ingredients list next time I buy heat protectant.  If the main ingredients aren't oil based, I don't want it. Especially after this experience.  The only times I used this with success was when my natural hair needed some moisture, and i didn't want to spritz it directly with water, so I used this a a freshener on my no heat natural hair.

5.0,Great for all hair types & affordable,"I have been searching for a great heat protector for my hair since I like to apply heat to it very often using flat & curling irons. I was so glad when I found this heat protector by HSI Professional. Firstly, I was so glad of the packaging of the product, it was wrapped very securely protecting it from leaking or the handle being damaged during shipping (which has happened with other products). I used the product during my morning hair process of straightening my hair the next day and I was very impressed. The smell of this product is AMAZING!! It goes on very light and it's not oily or heavy. After pressing out my hair, I could tell the difference in texture and shine on my hair (which is very thick and curly). Throughout the day, I could tell the difference with the frizziness....there was none. I've also used this product on my hair extensions with the same great results.
