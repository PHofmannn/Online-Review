4.0,Better for long term damage. Use #6 for instant befits.,"With #3, you get smoothed hair and long-term repair. The downside is, you have to use a generous amount of product to see immediate results. I don't use #1 or #2 but I'm guessing this works better when combined with those. The scent is great. I didn't find it as moisturizing so the 3rd time I used it I ""washed"" my hair with just conditioner afterwards and preferred those results. I did purchase #6 as well, which I gave 5 stars for instant, smoothing results and I only need a dime size of #6 on my long hair. My hair is colored but not damaged - I definitely recommend #3 for long-term help with damage and #6 for smooth results that make hair look better instantly and over time.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFVTVAR5V6XKWMVHARHZXRCOSHIQ,2019-07-05 09:32:22.512,0,True

4.0,Expensive but gets the job done,"Olaplex absolutely worked for me. In two sessions, it restored my over-colored/over-heated hair to a more attractive texture and has strengthened it noticeably. My pictures show my hair brushed after drying naturally before Olaplex, then after a home-coloring and two treatments of Olaplex. I love that you can leave the treatment on your hair and let it work overnight and it doesn't leave your head greasy. The downside as many have stated is the price and amount you get (one bottle only contains enough for me to use it three times, and my hair could use more repair than that). I wish this product was more affordable so people on different budgets could treat themselves. Will I buy it again? Maybe once in a blue moon when my hair is especially dried out and when I can spend a little extra.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFKHbjlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFKHbjlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FaFKHbjlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SA4CvtjqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SA4CvtjqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SA4CvtjqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHFRACPXL66EOUHNAJTWLDGTODGA,2020-01-14 22:23:20.289,5,True

5.0,I love the results!,"If you bleach your hair to make it blonde, you simply must use olaplex because it justnplaun works. Bleaching strips each hair shaft, makes it thinner, brittle and dry. Olaplex number three helps build it back up, repairing weak spots. You end up with hair that almost feels as if you hadn't bleached it. Your hair is stringer and sleeker again, instead of ""fried"". I remember long ago Kim Kardashian saidnshe leaves it on under a shower cap overnight and washes it off in the morning. I tried that and the sound of the shower cap woke me up too much and was coming off and messy. So now I just put it on generously and out it all up in a clip for several hours as I hang out around the house and wash it out, condition and air dry. I love this stuff and have bought it many times now. I have sort of long and thick hair- so I get three treatments out of one of these little bottles.  It is so worth every penny for me. P.s. it does not add moisture to hair, but rather adds proteins etc to build and heal hair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L9dfB9YiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L9dfB9YiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L9dfB9YiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ks78zemL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ks78zemL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ks78zemL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vIOspyOlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vIOspyOlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vIOspyOlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFKGRCOG6AJN54RRLKSI4VJMDUAQ,2019-07-12 08:51:56.716,16,True
5.0,It works !,My hair was over processed and I was left with crispy crunchy ends and some stretchy when wet sections. I applied some Olaplex on damp hair and let it sit for about 10 hours with a processing cap on overnight. This stuff is the real deal.

That has nothing to do with Olaplex no. 3 Anyway I was pretty let down by the product the only reason I gave it some stars is I do think my hair felt a bit stronger. That IS what this product is supposed to be for, strengthening hair. Everything else about it is pretty sub par.<br />  The scent is okay, but it's not much of anything one way or the other. The product was a bit thinner than I was expecting. I was also surprised when I read the directions. Apply to towel dried hair, then follow with shampoo and conditioner. I figured it would be the other way around, use after conditioner, but no.<br />  So after getting my hair wet, then drying it off a bit with a towel I put some of the product on my hair. It didn't really coat my hair very well.<br />  I have baby fine hair, tons of it, longer but not too long. It's bleached out from dark brown to light blonde, and could always use more moisture and strength. I figured this would be just the thing to help me as I try to grow my hair to be very long.<br />  It took so much product just to coat all of my hair!!

1.0,Ruined My Hair,"I purchased No. 3 from my salon to just give it a try as I was planning to have the whole treatment at my next date in two weeks. I cannot believe that 40 minutes of this on my head has basically ruined my hair. Followed the directions. The next morning my hair started breaking off in pieces ranging from 1/3 inch to almost the whole strand. Weird tiny splits appeared in random places on the hair shaft. And talk about restructuring--I did not know that hair shafts could twist themselves into such weird configurations.<br /><br />I waited three days then shampooed and conditioned with my usual products in the hopes of getting this horrid thing out of my hair. This resulted in almost every hair on my head splitting. In other words, I have a headful of split ends. Words cannot describe the damage done. Since my hair was dry and had some SLIGHT breakage, I tried Olaplex to see if it made any difference. It sure did. My hair's previous brittleness and breakage increased by 50%. The texture feels strange; hair loss occurring as well which is scary since my hair was thin to begin with. Put a barrette on it yesterday and it slid down my hair from eyebrow height almost falling off at the end.<br /><br />Problem is, I had researched a lot and read all the glowing reports. It was only after doing more research after I used it did I fine many, many women having the same result I got. Worse, one cannot get this product out of the hair; it is in for good. Some poor gals with long hair like myself said as time went on the damage kept occurring until they had to get 5 inches of hair cut off. Took me 1 1/2 years to grow my hair to mid-back.

5.0,It is wonderful on its own,"It is wonderful on its own!  Recently I've started to use it together with Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask to condition my hair in the shower.  A couple of years ago, my hair dresser taught me to put the Olaplex on my hair about 45 minutes before setting out to get my hair done, and she would also use it after shampooing me at the salon.  My hair was incredible.  A month ago, I discovered that I have an autoimmune condition that is making me lose my hair.  I've experimented with many things, but this product has helped me to the greatest extent that something external can help me save my hair.  So, what I do is that after the shampoo, I mix the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask with Olaplex, condition, and then I wash it out.  My hair becomes silky smooth, and I also lose very little hair on the brush afterwards. Before I was losing clumps.  For a month now I also make my own home-made pomade with 100% raw ingredients from the health store:  aloe vera, shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba, argan oil. I also mix in some liquid vitamin E and a fingernail's worth of O'Keefe's Working Hands (this has glycerine in the correct concentration that is good for the hands--and hence also good for the scalp).  I've started to use Henna from Mom's Organic Market for color, instead of the great product that my hair dresser would use before (I miss my lovely color very much but alas, it is now too drying for a suffering scalp, whilst Henna is 100% natural and is known to strengthen problem hair).<br /><br />I am saying all this in case it helps someone.

5.0,People who complain about price and damage are ignorant.,"There are two common reviews that I want to address.  1st, that the product is damaging their hair.  If you need Olaplex, your hair is already damaged.  You hair is falling out and breaking because you bleached it.  Olaplex is amazing but it isnt going to glue your hair back together.  What it will do is bond your hair that hasnt yet reached the point of breaking and it will help but some hair cannot be helped. 2nd is that the product is too expensive for what you get.  (sigh)  So here is the deal,  You tried to bleach your own hair because you thought it would be soooo much cheaper.  Your hair is burned and falling apart so now you want to find a cheap way to fix your hair. (sigh)  Insert Brand Mondo rolling his eyes.  Good product costs money honey.

As we are all stuck in quarantine status.. I have been doing all I can to invest in my brand. That includes being more detailed and consistent in my self care routines. I have neglected my hair for probably over 2 years, washing it less, not deep conditioning, or anything other than wearing it in a ponytail 🥴 First step I began taking collagen supplements a year ago, consistently, but with through out the winter month my hair  became extremely dry & began to fall out whenever I combed.. Concerned about thinning, I came upon this product and was intrigued naturally. Used this recently this week and the results are so positive. After washing, treatment, wash & dc... my hair is not brittle, or frizzy. Also I realized the Neocell Collagen + C supplements have lead to significant hair growth... dounke positive. I spread this treatment out in sections focusing in the middle to end, comb through my hair redistributing product around the crown, cover my hair foe 90 mins then rinse out. I do not heat treat my hair, at all, allowing the hair to air dry. I plan on treating my hair with this product once a week until the bottle is gone.

4.0,For the blonde people...,Hair type: Naturally Kinky/Curly but sometimes I wear it straight or in braids<br />My natural hair color is sandy brown but I have been coloring my hair blonde for about 7 years- I have had different shades of blonde from golden to platinum (almost white hair). For the past year I have been wearing braids because I just can't keep up with the styling with this blonde hair. Blonde hair worked best for me when my hair was very short (like 3 inches long). Over the years I have concluded that blonde hair is just not healthy - there really isn't product that I have found to make or keep it healthy.  I have tried a number of things! I was told by a stylist that Olaplex is the way to go. I have numbers 1-3 and have used this system for about 3-4 years now. The product is decent and if you pair it with hair steaming it can work pretty good.  You also may want to keep it on overnight if you are able to do that. My honest opinion is that Blonde is just a harsh color...so don't expect too much out of this or any other product. You either get the color you want or healthy hair but I believe that with blonde you can't have both (unless your natural hair color is light or close to blonde).  I am no professional- just speaking from my experience. I hope this helps someone!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616VNpubVuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616VNpubVuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616VNpubVuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XV7D5utLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XV7D5utLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XV7D5utLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHYSWZHUTCDBAWADAC3CFYEOCD3A,2018-05-09 16:23:51.379,7,True

5.0,I am fairly certain this helped save my hair,"I used this for damage control after bleaching, and that's exactly what it did. I bleached my hair twice, and then dyed and toned it all in less than 24 hours, while using this in between, and I have very little to no breakage. I did use a different brand of bond protector while actually completing the bleaching and dying process (with different ingredients than Olaplex), but even after rinsing out the bleach and toner and color, I could feel that my hair was ""dry"" even while it was still wet (some of you know what I'm talking about!). This is where I applied the Olaplex - It has a recommended ""sit"" time of 10 minutes, but I left it on for about 30 each time. My hair is very soft, no ""crunch,"" has shine, and I sustained very little (if any) damage. I read somewhere that this No3 is supposed to build off of their No1 and No2, but I used this as a ""stand alone"" with that other bond protector I mentioned and it worked! I will probably purchase their maintenance shampoo. Also should be noted that even though I have done my hair many of times on my own, this past experience was a little more out of my control and I found myself having to do a few ""Hail Mary's"" to control the situation.

It turns out my hair is actually very curly - 2C/3A, low porosity, and coarse.

It helped my curl pattern tighten even more and it really helps undo any damage you may have been doing to your hair.  It's almost like a reset button.  I usually layer it on dirty hair on a wash day with my deep conditioner and let it sit under a hot cap for 30-60 minutes.  Then, I shampoo, condition, and style as normal.  (I do dirty deep conditions because it helps with preventing build-up on my low-po hair.)  It is pricey, I will say that.  But, a little goes a very long way and I usually can go months before I have to buy a new bottle, even using it fairly heavily on a weekly basis.

5.0,A Very Happy Pravana Girl,"I've heard rave reviews about Olaplex for about a year now, and decided it was time to try it for myself.  I went with the #3, as it is cheaper, but now that I understand the difference between #1, #2, and #3 I'm going to get the kit with one and two only from now on.<br /><br />Olaplex #1 is the solution at one hundred percent.  This is the Olaplex that can be mixed into your developer/ powder to protect your hair during bleaching.  (I'm doing my roots soon, as they have grown out and are now several inches in length, and also plan on lightening up to a ten to do pastels/ grey, so I'll be trying Olaplex #1 with my bleaching routine- will review how it goes in a couple weeks)<br /><br />Olaplex #2 is used right after #1 for the deep treatments that salons do (which cost forty to fifty dollars).  It is the solution diluted to 15%.  Basically, it's Olaplex #1 mixed into a nice conditioner.  It is also used after color treatments/ bleach has been rinsed out of the hair to restore the damaging effects of coloring.<br /><br />Olaplex #3 is similar to #2, only it is the take home version created for non professionals.  This solution has been diluted to about 12%, and is therefore not as strong as #2, and needs to sit on the hair longer.<br /><br />My hair is a level 3, and gets stripped two or three times a year, so that I can create Pravana masterpieces on my head.  I do bleach washing (equal parts developer, powder, and shampoo- and now that I know-  1/8 ounce of Olaplex 1 per each 3 ounces of bleach bath), and regular application with foil for the second round.  I always sleep with coconut oil saturating my hair the night before, and apply bleach mixture directly over- this does not change processing time at all.  I use 40 developer from Schwarzkopf, and depending on how the first processing goes, I use 20 or 30 on the second round.<br /><br />My hair is definitely very dry, but I haven't had breakage issues in a couple of years (tried a new routine, and it was a fail!).  However, two small sections of my hair are longer than the rest, and these sections I leave in two braids.  The braids have been bleached out way too many times, and as a result these sections of hair are completely fried.  When they are not braided the hair is ultra dry, frizzy, fuzzy, with crispy ends, and straw like.  I'm not sure how this hair even stays attached, honestly!  It is a credit to the coconut oil, and the high quality products that I use that this hair hasn't disintegrated into powder.<br /><br />For my first try with Olaplex #3, once I had the stuff I sat online reading all about it, and perusing reviews.  I ended up putting it in my hair right before I went to bed, combing it through, and leaving it in overnight.  In the morning I got my hair a tiny bit damp by brushing it with a wet brush, and then I added some more Olaplex #3.  After that I did a few morning chores, and worked out for maybe an hour.  Then I rinsed.  While rinsing I was expecting my hair to glide around like a silken wonder the way it does with really awesome conditioners, and then worried when this didn't happen.<br /><br />Once my hair dried though, WOW!  The two fried sections are now smooth and soft like real human hair again.  No more frizz and fuzz.  The ends aren't crispy (they would get crispy about a week after trimming), and are shiny and soft.  These two sections are still drier than the rest of my hair, but the improvement overall is pretty damn impressive.<br />My hair is glossier, smoother, and the typical &#34;routine&#34; dryness is totally gone.  The virgin hair at my roots is like a glowing wonderland, so I'd recommend Olaplex even on hair that has never been color treated.<br /><br />I am very excited to try the #1 and #2 in a couple of weeks when I strip my roots.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712Ui5jCtwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712Ui5jCtwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712Ui5jCtwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ci9erzD7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ci9erzD7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ci9erzD7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01LDFHH1K,B00SNM5US4,AHVK4Z5N5TACEEUM4WTYSEJCFZTA,2017-04-06 00:40:20.000,7,False

3.0,Detailed Review,"Okay, so I've been using this consistently for about 7-8 months (only bought it once or twice from amazon, then Sephora the other times).<br />I was recently on Accutane for 6 months (an intense acne drug) and it completely DESTROYED my hair. It went from soft and relatively healthy to absolutely fried. It looked like I bleached it 20 times a day for a week, literally. SO, I finally decided to splurge on Olaplex.<br /><br />I used this one (No. 3) in conjunction with Number 0 Intensive Bond Building and Number 6 Bond Smoother. The medication I was on made it so that my scalp made literally no natural oils anymore, so I can only wash my hair once a week at most, so I used Olaplex every time I washed my hair.<br /><br />Right after using it, it does make my hair so much better. It makes it very soft and smooth. However, after 2-3 days, it's not longer like that at all. It goes back to looking fried and dry. I figured this would be the case at first, but 7 months later and this is still the case. So, this makes me believe that this is one of those products that leaves a ""film"" over your hair, and that's what makes it smooth. It does NOT heal hair or help repair it by any means whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, I do like this product. It does make the hair smoother. But the marketing makes it seem (especially on their website) like it actually repairs bonds. It does not. In order for it to make your hair consistently smoother, you'd have to use this 2-3 times a week. And that could get VERY expensive. However, don't let that deter you from buying it. I do think it's worth a try, especially since most people don't have hair as damaged as mine, and it may be awesome for you.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHBQFHC5SFTYQVLJHCUBM4O7IXMA,2022-07-12 15:50:02.453,7,True

5.0,Miracle product,"My daughter is very into all of her instagram beauty gurus , and one of her favorites has been using this product. She also wants to try all the different colored hair dyes they use. She has dark dark brown hair , so she’s had to bleach her hair a few times . We went to a salon and had an Olaplex treatment and were amazed by how soft and healthy her super damaged hair looked and felt. This isn’t the entire treatment that you get in a salon, it’s the product to use at home to maintain the treatment , or skip the treatment and use on its own. I recently had most of my really long , dark brown hair bleached and colored and I could barely comb through my hair. I thought I was going to have to cut a lot of it off. I bought this to see if I could salavage my hair . Without having the salon treatment , just using this on my own , my hair was super soft and silky ! Even healthier than before I bleached it. I have to use it two to three times a week to maintain the perfect smoothness , but I only used it once this week and my hair still looks pretty good .","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t0uUC8ddL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t0uUC8ddL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t0uUC8ddL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7106AeOxCBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7106AeOxCBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7106AeOxCBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEJFMGGBFDIHHWPJDYEYZKEQN6GQ,2018-07-08 17:35:40.719,19,True
5.0,Makes my dry hair looks lively,I used to work in beauty saloon and all our hairdressers were using Olaplex products to protect client's hair from damaging while coloring.<br />I use it now for myself.

5.0,"It really is a miracle, worth every penny!","First of all, I was nervous about possibly receiving a knock-off product. I believe that what I received is genuine, based on the results I have gotten thus far.<br /><br />I ordered this after I severely damaged my hair through bleaching. Certain sections of my hair literally felt like gum. I knew if I combed through those sections, the hair would literally break right off, and some of it did!. I panicked but did some research and ordered this product. I read other reviews/instructions and here is how I used it.<br /><br />1. Wash your hair very gently (because it is already presumably damaged, like mine was) to get rid of any product build-up and oil. The olaplex needs to be able to penetrate the hair, so your hair should have NO PRODUCT of any kind in it when you apply the olaplex. If your hair is clean, just rinse it so that it is wet. Do not use conditioner, leave-in conditioner, or any oils. Just wash it and rinse out the soap with water. (My hair is already so damaged that I don't like the idea of washing before AND after, but it is necessary with this product. So when I wash before applying the olaplex, I will wet my hair in the shower, apply a little sulfate-free natural type shampoo onto the actual hair--whereas when I usually wash, I concentrate on the scalp and just let the suds fall down the length of the hair--and gentle suds the product, then rinse with water. I do this to just get the build-up off because when I rinse out the olaplex, I will wash it properly and I do not apply any olaplex directly on my scalp or roots. This is just another step I take to try to preserve what hair health I have left.)<br />2. Towel dry very gently so that it is damp, not soaking.<br />3. Concentrate the product where you have the most damage. Once you have saturated those areas of your hair, put a little on the rest, and gently comb through.<br />4. Immediately put on a plastic shower cap to keep the product from drying out. Also, this helps use the natural heat from your body to (presumably) assist the olaplex in penetrating your hair.<br />5. Sleep on it! I leave it on for 12 hours at a time.<br />6. In the morning, rinse out the olaplex, wash your hair, and then use a good conditioner.<br /><br />I did this twice, then did a variation where I did steps 1-6 above, but after applying the olaplex and before applying the shower cap, I also applied a hair mask over top, slept on it for about 11 hours, and finished up the steps as written above.<br /><br />(This is my variation on getting the best results, so be sure to adapt this to what works best for you.)<br /><br />The directions say to use this 2-3 times per week for severely damaged hair. I have used this three times so far and cannot believe the results. My hair is nowhere near 100% healthy, but the areas that felt gummy now either do not feel gummy at all, or are about 75% improved. I am pretty sure that if I did not purchase this, I would be sporting a pixie cut right now. I plan to continue using the olaplex 2-3 times per week and eventually drop the frequency when I feel my hair is healthy enough to do so.<br /><br />I've read some reviews complaining about the cost of this product, and it is no doubt pricey. For me, it has been 100% worth it because my hair was literally about to fall off if the wind blew too hard. I am so grateful to have saved it. After 3 applications, I have barely made a dent in the product. I would estimate that I've used maybe 10% of the product? Maybe 15%. My hair would be categorized as long, it is past my shoulders by several inches (but not super long, like not down to my waist or anything.)<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out that this is NOT a hair mask or deep conditioner, and it is not. My hair does appear shinier after using it, and it may be softer, but it is in a way that it feels healthier. Your hair will not feel like you just used a hair mask/deep conditioner. It will feel stronger, less frizzy, more manageable, and I have also noticed that what breakage I do have from the bleaching is not noticeable because those hairs are more weighed down (does that make sense?)<br /><br />Overall, I am EXTREMELY happy with this purchase. I was skeptical, reading all of these reviews stating that this was THE MIRACLE product, but I am sold on it now. I will continue to use the product and update this review if needed. I would say that if your hair is severely damaged, the price is worth it, and the product does exactly what it claims to do.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHNSH6WEIPV6Q5YKB7JTLCUNN7EA,2019-04-28 00:41:21.881,124,True

So, that said, this product did leave my hair soft. VERY soft which, given the thin, fine, straight nature of my hair, isn't as wonderful as it would seem. My hair does feel very soft but soft do not compensate for it being FRIZZY or flyaway, which my hair still is DESPITE using Pur'ador cream rinse especially FOR thin, dry, permed hair. Also despite my very tight, curly perm, here's absolutely NO body left in the curls. Imagine perming a 3 year old kid's hair and that's about what I have.

4.0,I'm Pretty Happy.,"With *REPEATED* use, yes there does seem to be some improvement.  I think it's fair to say that each person's experience is going to differ from other's.  My experience is with recent excessive hair processes, my hair became very badly damaged.  I began using Olaplex again after taking a long break and with repeated use, there is an increase in some shine,  less burn frizz, less sticking out dry pieces, overall less brillo looking hair and more a return to healthier looking hair.  No miracles, but with repeated usage (so far about 3 weeks) there is a noticeable difference. My hair first felt better, then slowly began to look better.  I'm using it not as instructed, but every time I wash my hair I mix it with a deep conditioner and leave it on in the shower for as long as I can (5-10 mins) during my morning shower. I just don't have the luxury of time to follow the instructions as-is.  Nonetheless, with consistency, I do see an improvement.  I'm glad I got it. I did hope for better, but it is improving the quality of the hair to a degree which honestly was badly damaged.  I recommend but will say, there's just been no magic wand for me with this.  If my schedule was different and I could follow the instructions to a T, then maybe it would be closer to a miracle, but since this isn't possible at this time, I'm pretty happy.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGLL37KZAUFRXC7MZNYHAHP6HWKA,2019-01-07 02:01:18.484,6,True

5.0,Great hair repair treatment,"Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 Repairing Treatment, 3.3 Fl Oz<br /><br />I started using this product about three years ago after my previous cosmetologist torched my hair. He ran permanent hair color through my hair which had previously had permanent hair color on it. He should have used semi-permanent and should have prepped my hair with Olaplex prior to coloring. The bottom 3 inches of my hair looked totally fried.<br /><br />I switched stylists and she uses Olaplex in color treatments. Prior to switching, my cousin talked me into using the hair perfector number 3, stating it had improved her hair dramatically. I used it weekly prior to my appointment with my new stylist. She said my hair looked so good that she didn't think she needed to mix the Olaplex in with the color she planned on using.<br /><br />Olaplex is a great product. If you are going to a stylist that is unfamiliar with the product, hire another stylist, literally. If he or she doesn't know about it, the person isn't staying up-to-date on new techniques.<br /><br />Finally, just to be clear, this product is not a moisturizer--it is a bond perfector. When applying the product, you wet your hair (no shampooing first), then apply it and comb it through. After letting the product set on your hair for the specific length of time recommended on the bottle (I leave it on for about an hour), you then shampoo it out and follow up with a conditioner. If you try to use this product as a conditioner, which it isn't, it will leave your hair looking extremely dry.

5.0,authentic & results on 1st use,"I bleached my dark brown hair which had been previously box dyed and it started to feel dry. For my 1st time bleaching my hair I knew it would turn orange/yellow but I also didn't want to ruin all my hair. I decided to give my hair a break for at least a week or two before my next bleach session. In the meantime I ordered olaplex no 3 from Amazon. There are tons of reviewers saying this isn't real but I don't know what they're talking about. I checked Olaplex's website and Amazon IS AN AUTHORIZED seller. I checked my barcode, and I also checked the consistency and scent of the formula and it all checked out fine before I used it. I had only ever had treatments in the salon before but it had been years since my last one. I'll never forget their distinct scent though and this is it. I was a bit apprehensive at first, mostly due to the reviews- but also just because i had never tried this on my own before. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! This stuff gave my hair so much life back. It's now so soft and smooth, and even looks shinier and healthier. I went ahead and ordered olaplex's no4,5 &6 from Sephora only because they offer Klarna (payment plan) and i'm on a budget. I will totally order from Amazon again in the future and have no issues or thoughts about their products not being legit. I honestly feel like some people either just don't get the results they desire or jump on a bandwagon and get brainwashed because I couldn't find anything wrong with this product but that's just my opinion. Please also make sure you use the product exactly as directed, this is NOT a hair mask and is meant to be washed out of your hair. Their website even says it only works when your hair has moisture in it.

Overtime because it will recover your hair you will feel it stronger. I recommend leaving the product over night and when washing condition and use a hair mask. It will leave your hair flawless.

1.0,Dangerous Combination of Ingredients,"Does this product work well? Yes. Amazingly so, in fact, it probably saved my hair after some bad hair dye decisions. However, I was curious and read through the ingredient list on this one and No. 6. I noticed that they both have Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Sodium Benzoate among the listed ingredients. These chemicals are fine separately, but are not supposed to be combined because the Ascorbic Acid causes the Sodium Benzoate to turn into Benzene.<br /><br />According to the CDC,  ""Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells, which can lead to anemia. Also, it can damage the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells.""<br /><br />I am really disappointed to find out about this dangerous ingredient interaction because this product worked really well for me.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGUW2Z2WXZSYEPQLGLESM374IN3A,2022-11-27 23:11:37.591,23,True

5.0,Results get better with continued use,"I've been using this product biweekly for the better part of a year now, and I really like it. I would use it weekly, but it takes 1/3 to 1/2 a bottle to saturate my hair, and the cost of using it twice as often has so far dissuaded me.<br /><br />I wash with a clarifying shampoo to make sure I don't have any lingering silicones or product in my hair that might interfere with absorption, then apply this throughout dampish hair. I usually put it up in a bun and cover with a processing cap to keep it from drying out (since it supposedly stops working once it dries?). I get the best results if I wait at least 4hrs before shampooing, preferably 6hrs. I haven't gone 8hrs+ yet but I suspect it might work even better.<br /><br />After a follow-up shampoo and condition, my hair feels softer and looks shinier. I don't know if it's actually stronger, but it definitely feels less brittle and more hydrated. I haven't noticed an increase in shedding or breakage despite dying every couple of months, which I started only in the last year, just before I started using No.3.<br /><br />Side note, I've purchased No.3 from the manufacturer's website as well. The products appear identical and, on my hair at least, seem to work the same way.

5.0,Olaplex 3 has made more difference to my hair than…,"any other product. Hands down. I’m such a skeptic when it comes to the claims of hair products – even those with overwhelmingly good reviews. Hair is dead. Most improvements are the result of silicones and other chemicals ‘coating’ the hair shaft – and it’s all temporary. But… Olaplex 3 is different – it actually penetrates the shaft and helps to strengthen and repair hair. And it helps prevent further damage. Root to tip. That bears repeating… it strengthens hair. This isn’t a moisturizer mask for damaged hair… that’s just a coating. This helps repair hair.  Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate is the patented, magic-like ingredient, and yes, it works!<br /><br />Your hair needs to be wet for this to absorb into the shaft, so dampen it or wash it, towel it a bit, then apply and comb through. I put a plastic bag over it to keep my hair to keep it damp, and leave it on 10 to 45 minutes (45 being best). I do this prior to a shampoo, once a week. It takes very little to coat the hair.<br /><br />Results? After 2 uses my hair was vastly improved. After 4 uses it was Amazing. I can see the difference and feel the difference. I’d overprocessed my hair to the point of crispy ends. Then I bleached it. Ever made a big oopsie and over-bleached to the point where your hair feels stretchy? Yep, that bad. Each comb-through left short pieces of hair on the countertops. Olaplex 3 brought it back from that. And now, after only 9 uses, my hair is in the best condition it’s ever been in. Very shiny, not weighed down, strong, styles beautifully, and did I say very shiny?! I trimmed off the crispy ends after my first Oleplex use, and continue to process my hair with no more split ends… Without the constant split ends caused by my continued processing, my hair is growing longer, faster.<br /><br />This stuff is as close to miraculous as one can get when it comes to hair improvement and protection. I don’t say that lightly.<br /><br />UPDATE: 6 months later, and I’m still in awe. I use this (#3) along with #5 and #6 (shampoo and conditioner), and I’ve since added Olaplex 1 and 2 (sold as a set, you can find it new, just google) which is used when applying bleach or hair color. I use Redken permanent hair color with volume 20 developer every month. In the past the hair color damaged my hair, requiring frequent trims, and even then, my hair wasn’t healthy. Now, 6 months later, my hair has never been thicker, or so shiny, and so healthy as it is now. My hair is growing fast due to not needing as many trims, and the area around my forehead, which was thinning, is full of new growth. Wow. I use this product once every week or two.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEX7TXZP3ZGMVM7PSRU7EA7LQ2WQ,2021-12-14 21:51:47.713,2,True

This is a game changer product for me! I just wish I would’ve purchased this sooner as I alway use hair masks on a regular basis.

I reached to a point of extreme damage where my hair felt soo weak it would not even air dry on its own. It felt & looked like noodles & very gummy. It would take me maybe an hr to brush out my hair because of all the damage/breakage.<br /><br />I started taking better care for my hair.<br />I stopped using 10$ shampoos & started buying quality shampoos & deep hair conditioners + hair masks + oils + oraganic virgin oils.<br /><br />All these products did work for saving my hair , I did see improvement in time.<br /><br />But with one use of OLAPLEX ❤<br />Made my hair very soft & silky + healthier looking .<br />I usually use a special detangling brush because of all the knots I get from breakage & from all the bleaching I've done to my hair.<br /><br />With Olaplex 3 I no longer struggle to brush my hair or run my fingers without them getting stuck in my hair from tangles of dryed brittle hair.<br />This stuff is just what my damaged hair needed.<br />This was just half the bottle used on my 26inches of hair.

4.0,Compared it to one from Sephora and it's legit,"I bought Olaplex no 3 from Amazon a few years ago and it was alright. I probably washed it off too early.<br /><br />Since I bleached my hair recently, I wanted to get hair treatment products such as this to prevent further damage.<br />I bought it from Amazon again and let it sit on my hair for good 30min (few days before bleaching, bottom half had some bleached and dyed hair). I think it made my hair a little softer but not a miraculous result.<br /><br />I'll be using this more often on my bleached hair and come back to update my review.<br /><br />By the way, I saw so many reviews saying that this is not authentic here on Amazon and so I ordered the same thing from Sephora to see the consistency and the packaging. The only difference (very subtle) I see is that:<br />the label sticker on Olaplex no 3 from Amazon is not smooth and has that vertical fold/crack going down caused by the bottle shape beneath it. The bottle from Sephora looks exactly the same and the code is the same on the Amazon one but the sticker label on the Sephora one is smooth.<br /><br />I looked in close on both bottles and the Amazon's bottle is not completely smoothed out where the halves (the bottle is plastic and it's obviously made from sticking two halves together) meet are not sanded smoothly so the vertical center line sticking out causes the sticker to crease.<br />The one from SEPHORA though also has that verticle line in the center but it looks like it's smoothed out really well or something so while you can see the line, the surface is really smooth = no crease on the label sticker.<br /><br />Other than that, the consistency of the product, the fragrance, the stickers, prints, fonts, quality are exactly the same.<br /><br />I think it's important to get these from Amazon and make sure it's not sent from other sellers.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AF63XJ4KFR4YB3LCB52DM2EW6FIA,2018-05-27 13:15:01.436,42,True

2.0,DO NOT recommend on virgin/fine hair - from shiny to dull and brittle,"I wish I had never used this. In the words of my hairdresser (who has been cutting my hair for 13 years), ""What happened? Why is your hair fried?"" Good question - I don't even own a blow dryer or use any flatirons/curling irons. Shower PM and air dry has always been my friend. I have learned my lesson (everyone was talking about Olaplex) and DO NOT recommend this product for healthy hair!<br /><br />Initially I used this three days in a row (conditioning after) on my split ends and liked it, but in the week that followed my pony tail where I used it (upper shaft of hair was shiny and healthy) became extremely dry, brittle and tangled. This has destroyed the last 8 inches of my hair. I had to have 2"" cut off and then another 2.5"" the week after and even now, there is probably another 6 months that it will just have to grow out. I went from having healthy shiny hair with split ends to half of my head like straw. I have been deep-conditioning like a fiend (even after I used it) with many different recommended products, but nothing seems to help how brittle my hair is. The shine is just gone. Perhaps this works really well if hair is already color-treated or chemically damaged but on my fine healthy hair, even though I have a lot of it, it was extremely destructive.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGEAEMTQQSNYKSBJWA45EDH2RCAA,2019-09-13 18:04:15.480,0,False

5.0,Good for Damaged Hair,So I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.  She wets her hair and applies and sleeps in it ..with a cap.  I just wet my hair ( hair has to be wet) applied and kept on or an hour making sure my hair stayed damp.  The texture was improved but not to the extent I expected...BUT after using several times. I can now see a noticeable improvement in my hair being softer and less Straw like.  Will keep using... also make sure your hair stylist uses the first 2 steps in this lineup if you do highlights or color.  I told my hair stylist about this line up and she said she had been using it on me.. that is why I always say my hair feels better after I leave.  There is a whole line up of products in this line.  This one is step 3. Step 1 and 2 are for your stylist to mix in your hair color.  Step four and Five are the shampoo's and Conditioners.,[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHL7Y2JARDUKD4I6TFHBH4QC6YSA,2019-09-03 14:47:04.685,0,True

5.0,Number 1 product for repairing damaged hair like a professional,Anything from this company has changed the Hair industry. I have been licensed for 33 years & this is the first product that has been developed that actually heals the hair shaft from root to tip no matter how much you change the color of your hair or bleach it repeatedly like my daughter.  You should use the entire lineup in order to receive the best results. You won’t be sorry. This is an honest review. I don’t normally write them. I realize it’s expensive but it’s worth every dime. For long hair you should purchase 2 of everything.  Now also if you have split ends I would suggest that you trim just the ends off. It is difficult to repair split ends without trimming. Otherwise the hair shaft splits all the way to the scalp. Also if it’s been longer than 3 months without trimming your ends because the product is so expensive you want to ensure you start out with a fresh cut on your ends.,[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFZR2LL5RNIW2N3BNZI3YT6DAF4A,2020-05-17 20:13:25.900,1,True

I have bleached my hair and dyed it a lot in the past couple of months to get it a nice, bright, icy blonde balayage, so my hair is really damaged.

I recently cut 3 inches off to my shoulders.<br />I have been researching this product online for the past few weeks and kept this no 3 treatment on for 30 mins. I didn't find that it worked miracles, and my fried hair didn't improve much in appearance (still looked frizzy/brittle). My hair felt softer, but thats about it. This is why I don't really know if this product is authentic, because it felt like I was just putting a normal condition on my hair.<br />Perhaps with extremely damaged hair, it would take a couple of treatments of this, along with using steps 1 & 2.<br />No harsh odors from this though, but unfortunately there is no indication of authenticity to prove its the real thing.<br />Per the directions, I washed my hair with shampoo first since it says &#34;clean hair&#34; and towel dried. I know stylists that put this on dry hair, so next time I use it I will try dry hair and see if that makes a difference.<br />I also have a friend who is a cosmetologist and works out of her home, I am going to have her purchase this for me, I want to make sure I am using the real thing to get the full benefits.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHV24V3RKVX7BBM7H66W4MBUIH4A,2016-01-06 14:51:04.000,3,False

I put my hair through the works and even though it's strong after everything it goes through, after heat and styling irons it gets dry and damaged after time. Olapex No 3 is a lifesaver for my hair! From dry brittle hair to soft bouncy curls. It makes my hair smooth and manageable. I can put my fingers through it and just air dry for natural look or curl it for a more polished style.  After shampooing I put a few pumps of the Olaplex all over my hair from root to the ends and leave it in for at least 10 minutes. Then rinse it out with cold water. I try not to use hot water because that opens the hair follicles and creates more split ends. Cold water seems to keep the split ends tight and less visible and it looks more shiny. My stylist uses Olaplex when bleaching my hair also preventing any damage during the process.  I just wish they had larger sizes of this instead of the 3.3oz ones.

5.0,Made a believer out of a true Gen-X skeptic,"As a Gen-X skeptic, I pretty much approach claims made by beauty products with a grain of salt or less even....very rarely does a product come along that lives up to the hype, much less exceeds it.  This stuff did just that, I mean seriously...I cannot believe the difference after even just one use.<br /><br />I am now turning a skeptical eye toward the negative reviews on here, as they cannot possibly be reviewing this same item.<br /><br />As a 47yr old woman who has been having my hair colored (at home and professionally) for over 20 yrs, and who is also experiencing the wonderful side effects of menopause, my hair (which has always been thick and healthy considering the abuse I heaped upon it) had turned on me.  It was dry, brittle, and after a series of home bleach treatments when I incorrectly believed going silver was something I could do myself (I did it, but the cost was severe). I was suffering massive breakage, and no matter what I used, my hair was just done.  Completely fried and on the verge of total annihilation, and it was my last hail Mary attempt to save it when buying this item.  I had seen the videos and testimonials, and was totally skeptical that anything was going to undo the damage I had wrought, and the only way back for me was to cut off all my hair and start again....man, am I glad I decided to shell out the $30 bucks and give this a try.<br /><br />After the first treatment (yes, I am dead serious, one single use) my hair felt like it used to, before I started bleaching it to within an inch of its life a year ago....before mother nature drained all the liveliness, and body and thickness from my hair, even incredibly, it looked better than before I ever permed my hair into a sky in high nightmare in the late 80's...yup...it is the fountain of youth for your hair.  Mine now looks and feels as good as it did over 20 yrs ago.  Thick. Shiny. Soft. Bouncy. Gorgeous.  My hair is GORGEOUS AGAIN.  I have now done my third treatment, and there is still enough left in the bottle for one more. So, you get more bang for your buck than you think, with this size.  I didn't use anything other than Olaplex 3, and then my normal purple shampoo (L'Oreal vive) and then Olaplex 5 instead of my purple conditioner.  I only used the 5 on treatment days.  All other days I am washing and conditioning with my drugstore hair products.  The photos tell the story better than I could.  The first two are the silver which I just colored over two weeks ago to a softer/warmer blonde for the winter.  (Put a little olaplex in my hair color bottle too for good measure)  but the difference is way more than just the color.  The shine and softness literally shine through the photo.  My hair looks better than it did 20 plus years ago.  Thank you Olaplex.  Thank you so much I was in tears after the first use, and I am just so grateful.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617nbMwTWGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617nbMwTWGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617nbMwTWGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711vuOR9YNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711vuOR9YNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711vuOR9YNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oCVbGe3uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oCVbGe3uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oCVbGe3uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-GkswibLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-GkswibLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-GkswibLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AH2T4U2TFHMCTWLPDUHB37OXTPZQ,2022-12-05 00:54:39.872,225,True

After the first treatment my hair felt the closest to normal since double processing my hair.<br /><br />I had to do a double take and start the process over again when using Olaplex no. 3. You use it as a mask first on damp hair for 10 minutes and then go on to shampoo and condition. It felt very odd to do so but it’s worth following the directions.<br /><br />Ps if you see that my hair color is different in the before and after, it’s because I used a color boost with my conditioner.

5.0,It. Works.,"I severely damaged my hair in January, while trying to remove blue hair dye. Prior to the blue, I had platinum blonde, so I was trying to get back to that and used what was described as a “gentle method”. It totally fried my hair and I’ve been babying it to grow out the damage. My current “natural color” is light blue, so I use a purple color depositing conditioner on it with red tones. I kept reading about this product but was hesitant to try it, figuring it probably couldn’t be that great. I finally bought it and just used it today. My hair breaks like CRAZY when I brush it or hear style it. Until today. I wet my “dirty” (very little product) hair, and then put it all over and left it on for about 20 minutes. I washed it, and put a hair mask on for 10 minutes. Blow dried, and straightened with my normal heat protection and let me tell ya, my hair didn’t break off and sizzle and crunch. It’s soft and happy. I am going to continue to use it weekly as I move towards coloring my hair with developer again (probably another few months before I’ll feel ok to do that)<br /><br />So glad I tried it and I love how it has my hair looking and feeling just after one use. The picture uploaded is more purple because the red doesn’t last in my hair and using the olaplex/shampoo/conditioner did wash out my “ritual” shade, but it looks so healthy that that doesn’t bug me.

5.0,"For long haired scuba divers, this stuff is magic....","For my friends with long hair who dive... I’ve found something new!  Remember the last big breakthrough was the Crave gentle detangling brush (i assume its targeted at parents with little kids who have tough to brush hair)<br /><br />Now its Olaplex No. 3<br /><br />Yeah, i thought this was a joke.  Two separate (completely unrelated) stylists were like “use this stuff”.  I was super skeptical because I’ve always been told that hair can’t be repaired and you are kinda stuck with what you’ve done to it (at home I mean, cause i hear there are some crazy amazing salon treatments out there that I can’t possibly afford).  I didn’t buy at salon prices (luckily found it online for less).<br /><br />So currently my hair is X number of years long, mid back, stupidly baby fine, moderately over processed, dyed, bleached, sun drenched, and salt water destroyed.  I’m using the Olaplex 1 day a week (mostly because i only wash once or twice a week unless I’m diving a lot and of course have to remove the salt, but then its just with a conditioner)<br /><br />Results are kinda nutters.  hair in the drain has diminished after week 3, less breakage for sure, and my hair feels ridiculously silky slippery when dry.  You know that feeling that little kids hair sometimes has?  The kind of hair that the cuticle isn’t rough -at all-, so smooth that hair bands just slip out of it?  yeah, that.  For reals.  So yeah, week three, the jar of product is small but I expect it to last for at least another 10-12 applications.  The reviews say that hair keeps improving with each use.<br /><br />Historically by the time my hair gets this long its epically trashed and my hairdresser starts mentioning ‘maybe taking a bit more off the ends so it looks thicker?’, but this time around its going differently.  This time the stylist actually said ‘wow, you hair is better than it was last time!’  Big change 🙂",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFSS3ZT4QATL3A4MANB6GL3YYNBQ,2019-03-29 05:22:49.274,1,True

While it did help on the streak, the rest of my hair didn't seem to benefit at all. In fact it was less manageable than before.

5.0,Excellent to maintain red colored and straightened hair,"I'm naturally black/dark brown-haired and I've been coloring and straightening my hair for years. I've gone from my natural color to blonde and now to red. I started using this product from the time I changed to red few months back. My hairstylist said this product would both help lock up the red and also protect from the chemical processing. If you're a red head you know what I mean, very tough color to maintain. This product has been tremendously helpful in maintaining my red.<br /><br />It's a small bottle and I first felt like this is going to be a money drainer for me but it's not. I only use it once every 10 days to two weeks and also every time before I'm about to enhance the red at home. Each time I only apply couple tiny dollops of it so the small bottle lasts about 1.5 months for me. My hairstylist suggested that I leave it on for several hours or even overnight but I've never done that. I keep it on for only 10 minutes and it still does its job. So perhaps it would be even more amazing if I left it on for hours.<br /><br />The smell is good, not at all over-powering which is what I want because I'd rather my hair smells my shampoo and conditioner. Sometimes though, the product's after-smell can be a tad bit funky, I'm not sure how else to explain it, but that has never deterred from the product working great. The smell doesn't overshadow the shampoo or conditioner's aroma so I can't complain.

This has never happened before and I would say that I thought my hair would be more bouncy and healthier after using Olaplex products. I’ve spent more than enough money on this brand that I am still hopeful — maybe it will get better after six months, and I’ve used the brand for at least three months now. I am taking antioxidants, a multivitamin, biotin, collagen, and Omega 3s among other things and I don’t have any hormonal problems that would cause my hair to become brittle.

5.0,Don't know if real or not,"But... 1 had used my bottle twice and my hair did take to bleaching much better. Now saying that.... it didnt make my hair shiny or bouncy or moisturized as it just helps to protect the hair in between or after a bleach process. This is NOT a conditioner or miracle mask. If your hair was dry before... it will be dry afterwards that is why I would suggest (and instructions say) a deep conditioner after you wash out this formula.<br /><br />What I did try was the overnight process. Seemed silly. I'm a level 2 color and processed to a level 9. over the course of 4 years I have bleached and colored and removed color to add color and strip color and bleach some more, etc. I'm a bleach b. Cant help it. I'm also a 3A/B hair texture... half black and Asian. By year 4.... i had stopped going to the salon which uses olaplex 1 and 2 in my hair (which explains why I was able to bleach and dye my hair so much with barely any damage at all). ... and I would say 98% of ends are breaking off... i had cut about 4 inches of hair off and i still see i need to cut another 4!<br /><br />I pulled out my olaplex and said what the heck and kept it on overnight with my heating cap on. Wash it out the next day and deep conditioned.<br /><br />I used my regular oil and heat protectant, blow dry on cool setting and flat ironed my hair (which I stopped doing for a week) and my split ends literally looked like they disappeared! I wish I did a before and after. Much better results than just leaving it on for 10 minutes (which helped but I got an even better result leaving it on overnight). My hair looks healthy and it actually feels stronger. Yu have to personalize what you use after using this product to get the best results.<br /><br />Really good stuff!<br /><br />UPDATE: uploaded a few pictures of the changes in hair color I go through.. my hair has remained long and strong using olaplex.

4.0,SHAMPOO and CONDITION after. Don't let it completely dry in your hair,"If Olaplex broke your hair, it's most likely because you let your hair dry while it was in your hair. If u want to leave it over night u have to make sure your hair can stay wet. Also if you don't SHAMPOO and CONDITION after it can over strengthen your hair. Remember this is a BOND BUILDER, not a conditioner. If your hair is not breaking or at risk for breaking then you don't need to leave it in forever. Even if you don't sleep in it and you want to leave it in for a long time, you need to keep your hair at least damp while it's on.<br />With that being said, I bought mine from Sephora and it is a GREAT product. I don't trim much and had split ends. Those little tips breaking off. I've used it over night and for a couple hours and my split ends were visibly smoothed and stayed that way.

5.0,"Great, but Not a Miracle Worker","MAIN POINT: I do highly recommend as I'm familiar with Olaplex and stand by the statement that it does wonders for your hair -- but don't expect a miracle no matter how much you use or how long you leave it on your hair. What a lot of people don't know or they refuse to acknowledge is that you can't bring dead hair back to life once you've heavily compromised it. Only cutting it off will completely undo whatever damage you've caused to your hair.<br />I purchased this perfecter in order to start strengthening/prepping my hair throughout this  week for bleaching this weekend (I'm going from washed-out-red/orange back to blonde, so protection is def necessary), and after just 2, 1-hour-long uses so far I've already got noticeably softer hair.<br />1 downside I noticed is that my hair doesn't LOOK any different. I have naturally wavy, sometimes frizzy hair and the treatments have so far not tamed my texture so if you're looking at before/after pics where people immediately styled their hair after, then yes theirs will look really different because they styled it. I wouldn't recommend styling  until a couple of days after your last treatment as you've JUST added all that moisture back into your hair and styling immediately after is just gonna fry it right back out.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AERYO332HR344NBGO3E7LKTPKESQ,2020-04-22 13:54:55.586,1,True

Brush my dampened<br />hair with the Oraplex No3<br />Treatment.  I did start to add another product to only the front where men usually lose hair. Because my grandmother 's,A few Aunts had thinning hair because of medication and aging.<br />However I haven't found any other Treatment quite like Oraplex.<br />After I leave on for hrs & Sometimes sleep with it on.

I once read on a t shirt & a bumper sticker lol ""Gorgeous Hair Is The BEST Revenge ""<br />I don't believe I have any reason to be Revengeful.

I consistently used this for a month by washing my hair once weekly and using this as a pre conditioner or a mixed in my deep conditioner.  The heat damage is reverting and my hair bonds are thickening and looking stronger.  This definitely repairs the bonds and and give your hair life again no matter the texture.

My hair felt noticably softer and less damaged from the first use, I waited a couple days to retreat again and the 2nd treatment left my hair even softer.<br /><br />You use 0 and 3 before you shower, leaving each product on for 10 minutes (0 first, wait 10 minutes then apply 3 and wait another 10 mins then shower), 6 is for the end of your shower when your hair isn't soaking wet (but still damp)<br /><br />My only qualms are:<br />1) The Intensive Bond #0 requires you to seperate your hair into small sections to soak, but the nozzle they have makes this such a tedious task when you have thick hair, it just takes so much longer to soak the strands. Opening it and a bit in your hands isn't advised either because you can waste a lot of the product and at the price it is, you do not want to waste it.

5.0,Incredible,"THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER. If you still think this product is a conditioner or expect it to perform like one, stop reading. I have been getting my hair done professionally since 2008 and am very conscientious/knowledgeable about hair products/processes. I hadn't been able to find a hair stylist who is multi-talented (past typical hair color/balayage knowledge) and have been to 5 different stylists since May. I went to a different hair stylist for a full set of highlights 1 week after getting color/balayage done that was not done how I asked. The salon does not have Olaplex or any conditioning treatments, so my hair was subjected to 100% bleach. It looked and felt fried. My hair was no where near what I was looking for, so I booked with yet a different stylist for a new full set of highlights, color etc. I knew if I didn't do something to condition my hair before then that it would not tolerate any more chemicals without breaking off. I used the Olaplex 3 for 3 days straight. I left it on for 4 hours then washed with Amika Normacore shampoo followed by Marc Anthony Damage Repair Mask.  My hair looked and felt incredible. My stylist confirmed that whatever I did helped and that it allowed her to spend 6 hours on my hair. I would recommend Olaplex 3 to anyone with severely damaged hair from lightening/chemical treatments. I would not use it more than 3 times per week as too much protein will cause damage.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFDCWWSBOPGXYVXE6KXGWT6G2W2A,2020-08-10 17:30:52.913,7,True
5.0,Amazing!,"First of all, let me start of by saying if you receive a product without a safety seal, or you are familiar with Olaplex and the product just doesn't seem ""right,"" definitely send it back. Amazon gets it's products from MULTIPLE distributors, so unfortunately there is sometimes a (small) chance of getting a fake product. However, that being said I am pretty familiar with Olaplex, and the product I received was 100 percent authentic.<br /><br />I had made the mistake of being super impatient with my hair coloring process and did wayyy too much in a very short amount of time. My poor hair was NOT happy. It looked frazzled, poofy, and my color looked uneven/patchy and dull. I was afraid I would have to do a professional keratin treatment to get it to look healthy and shiny again.<br /><br />I had not done an Olaplex treatment in a pretty long time, and certainly hadn't done it on hair that had been pretty significantly damaged. I decided to give my hair a few days break and ordered Olaplex 3 off amazon. When it arrived I had put so many products in my hair to keep it tame, that I knew I needed to shampoo it first. I put the Olaplex on towel dried hair (thoroughly saturated the strands) and let it sit for 90 minutes.<br /><br />I shampooed my hair again with sulfate free shampoo the second time around, and then deep conditioned my hair for 20 minutes. While I was rinsing my hair, I could already tell that it fell so much better. After I styled my hair I was amazed. My hair was 95% better after just one use! I would have been surprised to see it even 70% better. This stuff is now my holy grail hair product. The more you use it, the more it is supposed to mend the hair. I can't wait to see what it looks like after a couple of more washes!<br /><br />My hair is shiny, the color looks even and professionally done since it corrected the dry patchy areas, and it feels so silky. I didn't have to do a 4 hour keratin treatment and kill my naturally curly hair for several months. My hair looks awesome and I feel like the price of this product is 100% worth it.

My hair feels softer and doesn’t get tangled up near the nape of my neck due to the breakage. I was very skeptical because every product says it will fix your hair. I actually think this is helping my hair. I don’t take writing comments lightly, and I wouldn’t say these things if I didn’t feel it was helping my hair.

I LOVE the aphogee two-step protein treatment. This is a different type of product than a bond builder I guess, but it made a huge difference in my hair quality. Also I make hair masks at home with luscious oils, honey, milk, eggs, avocado or whatever I have laying around.  I also have the L’Oréal bond strengthening shampoo and conditioner, very cheap price and noticeable results in hair, really looks and feels healthier. Also recently tried “mo knows hair, curl co wash and conditioner”, it’s a really nice cowash. Really great for dry damaged hair which doesn’t do well getting stripped with intense shampoos.<br /><br />Overall, I guess I don’t really know.

It's amazing.<br /><br />I have tried nearly hair mask you can get under $20. After using this twice in a week, my hair hasn't felt so soft or smooth since before I bleached it the first time. I *destroyed* my hair with bleach and color, and this stuff made it feel so healthy. The only downside to this stuff is the price. My hair is short, so I've been able to get 4-6 uses out of this little bottle, but that's really stretching it. If you have really damaged hair, I would highly suggest this treatment. I've heard of people using it during their coloring processing to prevent damage, but I haven't done that myself.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHCVGXVC6UKIE5SZCX6FHE5YZAKQ,2019-03-05 00:12:47.123,0,False
5.0,Holy Grail,"To say my hair has been through a lot would be an understatement. I’m a natural blonde with fine hair and I’ve gone from years of dark  brown box dye , to bleach blonde ,to ombré and everywhere in between. 2020 wasn’t my best year. And as much as I love to change my hair, bleach is not my friend. I was so scared that my hair would all break off, but alas, Olaplex saved the day. I swear..this is a holy grail product. Remember it’s a bond repair treatment to strengthen and repair the hair. It's NOT a deep conditioner/hydrating mask/oil/protein treatment etc, so don’t expect shiny hair. I like to shampoo first then apply a generous amount of  olaplex to wet hair, comb gently with a wide tooth comb, and put it up in a bun with a shower cap over it. Leave on for at least an hour,  shampoo and condition, and voila! Your hair will be on the road towards happy, healthy hair.

3.0,I'm Not Sure Where All The Hype is Coming From...,I have 2C very fine hair with medium health in the length from dying and a little breakage at the tips from bleaching hair about a year ago. This product leaves much to be desired. The consistency is of a very light leave in conditioner (I use light leave ins all the time - They are much better than this product nonetheless). I have not seen a bit of difference in my hair with Olaplex 3 (I'm at half the bottle and used as per directions). I see more difference in my hair after I oil my hair with Jojoba or Avocado oil than with Olaplex... So much hype for an overpriced product. Another fad trend.

1.0,The reviews about this causing fallout are true... Beware!,"My hair is pretty healthy; I endured a full set of highlights bimonthly for about 15 years, so my ends aren't fantastic, but I haven't color processed in almost a year and have been taking Nutrafol for 4 months, so the first 6-8in of my roots is about as good as it gets. I ordered this product as a Prime Day deal because I had been eyeballing it for a while with the idea that it would bring my bleach damaged ends back to life until they were finally all chopped off, and I gave it a good 3 weeks of exclusive use to see if maybe there's an adjustment period, but I'm convinced that this product is just not meant for people with fine hair (or oil glands). In the first week or so my hair started falling out waaaaaay more than usual; I would end up with a handful every time I washed (falling out from the root, not breaking off where the bleach damage was). I've had issues with excess oil since giving birth about a year and a half ago, but this made it so much worse! I wash my hair in the morning, and usually could go a day in between if I threw it up in a bun, but while using the Olaplex system I would have to put my hair up before I even left work for the day; if I had plans in the evening I would have to go home and wash my hair beforehand because it would bee too dirty to go out after an 8-10hr day, even hidden away in a clip. The No 4 shampoo and No 5 conditioner smell great, and the first few hours of the day my hair felt nice and had good body, but after lunch it's all downhill. The No 3 treatment is what caused the most fallout in my opinion, and the No 6 bond smoother leave-in made it feel tacky and tangle easily. After my month trial run I decided to switch back to my beloved patchouli CannaCell shampoo and conditioner, and I am so much happier at a quarter of the price!

3.0,Not perceptibly effective,I don’t see any significant improvement in my hair. My hair really needs repair. That is what this brand advertises. Doesn’t work any better than the one I bought for half the price possibly doesn’t do anything I’m not sure I find doing a mask of olive oil or neem oil with olive oil or somesuch thing is far more beneficial to my hair than any product that’s made for my hair specifically.<br /><br />Demodex mite;  Interesting fact by the age of 5070% of humans have mange. Not the really bad kind Demadex mange. Yes you can cat give it to your dog and your dog can give it to you. Most people don’t notice it unless they have a week immune system. I am allergic to it so I really noticed them. For many years though I didn’t feel a thing as they gobbled every single hair of my body and many of the ones on my head oh and those eyebrows are kind a leave in my face too. I recommendThe eyebrows with Gooey thick sunscreen type Chapstick or zinc oxide on them for daytime and putting a line of some non burning oil along the top of my eyelash. This is because these mites cannot walk in oil and they die.<br /><br />Some scientists believe that all baldness and hair loss is caused by these mites. Interesting huh? They first were found widely in the minoxidil laboratories. These little lights that eat hair a wildly attracted to men accident. So I wouldn’t use that if you have hair loss<br /><br />The best news: if you’re badly infested with these there is medicine it is called ivermectin. I convinced my dermatologist to give it to me even though he never found a single bug on me partly because many dermatologist have never heard about this might and partly because they are active at night during the day they stash themselves in a nice hair follicle and chew on it and well you know at the other end.

4.0,Works!,I learned about this product a very long time ago when I wanted to bleach my hair.  I wasn't sure if it would actually work or not despite seeing all the great reviews.  I recently bleached my hair from a dark brown almost black to a honey blonde which looked great but absolutely dried out my hair.  I knew I had to get my hands on a bottle of Olaplex to repair my hair somewhat.  I was skeptical of ordering through amazon due to some people saying that amazon is not a licensed distributor.  I don't know if this fact is true or not but the formula does work.  I think it may be watered down though.  One thing I must say is I saw it eliminated frizz which was an important factor for me.

5.0,Great on my postpartum uncolored hair! Priced same as salon,"The other reviews will tell you how awesome it is overall.

But also for those eager to grab off Amazon, just FYI that my local AVEDA salon sells it (I did steps 1 and 2 at my haircut) and the #3 was $28 there... so if you are worried about authenticity, you can get it at a licensed salon for basically the same (at this moment that matches Amazon). Of course that's more effort than Prime to the doorstep, but with so many ""is it fake?"" reviews I'm just letting you know- I actually figured it would be costlier at the salon!

I have used this product twice so far (it looks like each bottle should give me 3 treatment with my shoulder length hair).  My hair is colored (naturally about 50% gray, natural color is about a level 7 and I color it to an 8 and have some lowlights) I  have a little wave and frizz to my hair naturally and then add the wiry grays to the mix and I end up with a lot of frizz.  I try to combat this with using good salon products, leave ins, serums etc.  I also use a heat on my hair to try and tame it.  Years of doing this had taken it's toll and I finally decided to give olaplex 3 a try.  I left it on each time about 2 hours under a shower cap.  My hair felt much different even during the first rinse out.  It was softer, more manageable, and absolutely less frizzy.  The second time I used it was a rainy humid day.  I styled my hair with my dryer and flat iron.  I expected it to frizz up throughout the day like it does on most rainy days, but I was so pleasantly surprised that it did not!

2.0,It’s not a miracle in a bottle,"My hair was becoming brittle and dry.  My previous stylist started using the in-salon olaplex treatments and sold me on getting the shampoo, conditioner, #0 and #3 repairing treatment for at home. I used up the repairing treatment so ordered another from Amazon. The #3 repair came well packaged and seemed identical to the product from the salon so I’m pretty confidant that it was an authentic olaplex product. Here’s my personal assessment: it was a big waste of money. Not only did my hair not improve over the three months I faithfully used all of the products, it was starting to thin. While I wouldn’t go as far as saying the olaplex was responsible for the thinning, there was nothing about this expensive “system” that I could say made a positive difference in how my hair looked, felt or behaved. My hair looked terrific when I left the salon but that might have more to do with a salon blow-out. There are so many good reviews on how miraculous these products are. Could it just be it didn’t work for my hair or is it marketing hype that stylists and clients have bought into?? I stopped the in salon treatments and didn’t see that it made a difference. I’ve started using another brand that also has bond builders and treatments and my hair seems to be improving. I also stopped using heat as much and have improved my diet. That’s probably whats’s really made my hair healthier.

For most of my life, I have been unwilling to endure the level of extreme damage that this does to my hair. There's only so much of my life I'm willing to spend crying in the bathroom with a comb hanging from my head and half my hair on the floor. Now, I can (carefully) indulge.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, my hair is still damaged as hell. But this stuff REALLY helps. In the immediate aftermath of a bleach, it can take my hair from feeling like wet hay to normal hair that just happens to be really dry. And that's a difference that has allowed me to reunite with my love of colorful unicorn hair. Thanks, Olaplex.

After a couple months, my hair is thicker and stronger than ever! I absolutely love it!!!! This is staying in my routine!

I just kept thinking that “this time it would work better” but that wasn’t the case. Yeah, my hair felt a little bit more moisturized... maybe. But, don’t think I would purchase again. I read the instructions over and over thinking I may have been doing something wrong. But I would wet my hair, apply, wait, ( I found waiting linger than the 10 mins instructed didn’t really do anything beneficial ) I left in overnight one night and was scared the entire night because once it completely dries down into your hair it almost felt like my hair was going to break off if I touched it which is scary, of course.

2.0,"Used to Be the best product EVER, but either this is fake or Olaplex altered formula","*Updated below after initial review, my update is after my most recent purchase of this product in Oct. 2021.*<br /><br />Original Review: I can honestly attribute my healthy head of hair to the first 2 bottles of this product I ever purchased. After toying around with different hair coloring kits & then continuing to color regularly, my hair was completely shot. The natural curls I'd had were limp & pretty much altogether gone. My hair felt dry & I was like no way can this be happening. I did some research & came across this potion & bought it directly from Sephora the first 3 times. I have long thick hair & one bottle suprisingly did manage to provide almost 3 full applications each time.<br />Tip: Follow the directions completely, except I would lengthen the time you leave it in your hair. Reviews advised to leave it in overnight & I can tell you from experience that makes a big difference & it works much better.<br />Also I used a wide-toothed giant comb to make sure the goo was saturated over every hair.<br />The result was astounding. After my first go at it I woke up & showered & could not believe the difference. My hair was actually *healed.* Somewhere I read that since this is a ""bond corrector"" that it literally repairs your hair along the cracks of every damaged strand. Anyway, my curls that I'd thought were gone for good suddenly reappeared. My hair was shiny, soft again. After just one treatment.<br />I applied the remaining applications about every other week, bought a second bottle & did the same thing again, & I'm telling you my hair has permanently been better since those first 2 bottles almost 2 years ago.<br />I bought it a 3rd time, again from Sephora, but the third bottle didn't have quite the same amazing results. It still worked but not like the first 2. Then this last time I got it from Amazon. Olaplex may have changed the ingredients, as often horrible nasty price-gouging cosmetics companies do, but it didn't work that great for me this last time either.<br />So that's why only 4 stars. I'm willing to definitely try it again as soon as my budget allows & will update accordingly.<br />Olaplex if you've found a cure for dead hair don't be stingy. :)<br /><br />Updated Review (Nov. 2021):<br />I did recently try this again from amazon. They seem to definitely have changed the formula. Unless this recent batch I bought from amazon was just a total fake. I don't have the money to be wasting on crappy product.  I am angry. I have health issues and tried to do something good for my hair. It is not the same product I originally used. The conditioning effect lasted maybe a few days. I left it on overnight for 12+ hours. Don't waste your money. If Olaplex is doing this to make us buy their ""new products,"" that completely sucks.<br />$25+ for something that doesn't last is not worth my money.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFLOL6K4WAARAQWABD5GNXBTLCYQ,2021-07-20 06:36:12.831,0,False

Waited for 30 minutes, rinsed it off and followed with my shampoo and deep hydrating conditioner.<br />I let my hair air dry (I usually do that) and ... Before I put this stuff on I had natural waves, my hair was shiny and it did not look like an overused swab. I had some breakage, means my hair also luck protein, but since I'm also coloring my hair I blonde I thought this treatment could be nice.<br />I witnessed how it changed my friend's hair in best possible way. But this isn't my case. Perhaps because I color with Aveda and Aveda strongly stands against Olaplex being mixed with their product. I know I didn't mix anything, but maybe it has some bad reaction with the color I have...<br />I just hope it will rinse off...<br />If you're planning to try it, do yourself a favor and try on a little part first.

It’s in pretty good condition though and is 2 inches below my bra strap.  The ends tend to be frizzy so hence this product!  After washing it out and drying my hair I looked in the mirror and I was rather ecstatic with the results!  Plus it is shiny and feels like silk!  So is it actually Olaplex?

4.0,"Make it a routine, take it from someone who never did before!","(wife here) So many say it's not a miracle product but it is for me. I've home bleached and dyed for MANY years! I even tried at home relaxing... ( Caucasian Hispanic hair)To which I collected ziplock bags of my hair from the tub. Not lying. Ziplock bags... I tried giving my hair a break... Only to find gray hair about 1½-2 years later... So I looked for the best ways to heal it since it was a mess even after giving it so long a break and I was looking to color again. I did a deep conditioning before dying, dyed it and did this treatment 2-3 days after. I felt a little difference but it was still frizzy. I've used #3 nearly every time before washing my hair and #0 on several before #3. I noticed within 2-3 washes how little my hair is breaking now! Before it was like string cheese when wet, stretch for days before eventually just falling out by the handful. Now hardly any hair loss and near 0 stretch. It took more for me to calm the frizz, ether that was because it took time or the extra stuff I added I'm unsure. I've started a routine of using this(I limit hair washing to every couple days usually), shampooing with olaplex #4, conditioning with ion color sealer which I got from sally's beauty supply and then using olaplex #6 smoother leave in. My hair is getting softer as well as WAY less breaking AND my frizz was nearly zeroed, even after dying AND spending 3 days at a water park in chlorinated water! For the first time in my life, I actually styled my hair with a blow dryer instead of just flatironing it! It dries superquick, even when just air drying now. and I've always had trouble with my scalp. There was always build up like skin inches thick even though I hardly used any leave in/style product in my hair before this. Dandruff, salicylic acid, nothing helped. Used this, clean scalp and no itching!<br />It smells a bit perfume counter-ey, but not in a horrible way. My only two things was 1-i wish it takes  out the frizz more on its own and 2- even though I bought them as a pair, the ratio it takes to use #0 on my hair to #3 didn't fit the bottle size. I'm about 70-75% down on #0 but only maybe 40% down on #3. Even though #0 is a liquid it didn't seem to saturate as well as#3 by similar volume.... Still I highly recommend this routine!",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFJSXHN366N6OUYNBEPGQGVINBDQ,2021-06-19 05:13:05.370,0,True

5.0,Olaplex System For Life,"I'm freshly out of the shower after using Olaplex No. 3, 4, and 5 (shampoo and conditioner). In 2017, for the first time in my 54 years, I had crown breakage to the point of seeing my actual scalp! I hit YouTube and began to watch I don't even know how many hair tutorials on damaged relaxed hair, crown thinning, crown breakage, alopecia, going natural...  Now I'm not one for just buying products because someone else raves about it, but along with starting to make my own DIY hair oils and protein treatments, I did purchase a few products that really did wonders for my hair.  A main staple for life is Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo, conditioner, and treatment balm.  But I do have some other faves (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil, and Herbal Essence Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner).  Once a month I also use Aphogee 2-step protein shampoo and conditioner, and after a relaxer (which I do my own), I would follow the 2-step system with the hardcore Aphogee protein treatment.  November 2019, my hair was longer than it had ever been in my life.  I've never had long hair, so when my hair began resting on my upper back, I was doing cartwheels!  However, my crown was still an issue.<br /><br />To try something new, I began watching tutorials on ayurvedic hair care.  I purchased and mixed together some fantastic ayurvedic powders, which, had I used them as a treatment once in awhile, I'm sure my hair would have continued to thrive.  BUT, I made the mistake of adding a nice heaping of the ayurvedic powder to my hair oil that I would put on my hair daily as a moisturizer. After washing, conditioning, and deep conditioning my hair one week after a relaxer, I took the towel off and looked like Bozo the Clown!  My hair was straight but the ends were puff balls all the way around! My hair had never done that!  PROTEIN OVERLOAD!! I was heartbroken!  I gave myself a good trim, but for the next few weeks, hair was everywhere. My bathroom floor looked like a bear-skinned rug. Pieces of hair on the bathroom walls, sink, it was a mess!  Unfortunately I had to deep trim my hair to remove all the damage, which meant cutting ALL of the length that I had grown.  I still have decent length in the front, but I cut the back of my hair even with just above the nape of my neck.  It's hair.  It will grow back.<br /><br />I had been hearing about Olaplex for a very long time and I figured, if there was a time to try it, now is the time.  I let the No. 3 stay on my hair for 30 minutes.  I used a small dollop of the Olaplex shampoo and OMG the LATHER!  Could not believe it!!  After using the Olaplex conditioner, I was hooked.  After the conditioner, I loaded my hair with AsIAm Hydration Elation conditioner and oils.  I'm sitting with a plastic cap and steam cap on while I write this review.<br /><br />For those saying Olaplex made your hair feel rough or didn't work, well maybe that's true, or maybe you didn't follow up with a deep conditioning moisturizing conditioner afterwards.  I know Olaplex is a bond-builder, not a protein treatment, but they both strengthen the hair.  You have to replenish the moisture after this treatment or you may think it just left your hair rough.  I'm now streamlining my wash routine to twice a week.  The Olaplex system on the weekends, and the Joico system midweek.  And while I'll continue to make my own incredible hair oil, that will be the extent of my DIY concoctions.  I already know my hair is capable of growing strong and healthy, and 2 relaxers later, had I not damaged my hair, I wonder what length it would be right now.  But, I'm on my way back, and Olaplex is now along for the journey!!",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHFPOOK7VI35XDJED5FGOE33N62Q,2020-02-21 18:54:59.220,9,True

5.0,This product lives up to the hype.,"When I first started seeing people talk about Olaplex No 3 I was seeing the same old things: revolutionary product, will change your hair, repair, shine, smooth, reduce frizz, Heathy hair in one treatment! Uh-huh. Ok.<br /><br />I have hip length, 3B, CGM hair. I didn’t want to spend $30 on a product that was just like all of the other products promising the same things that I’ve been using for years. And for me a bottle would probably be one treatment. I was WRONG. This product delivers all of that on the first treatment. It is the single best hair product I’ve ever used.<br /><br />After one treatment (I can get about four treatments out of a bottle) my hair looked and felt better than it has in my entire life. I’ve been using 1 -2x per month and see improvement with every application. This stuff is amazing. It’s not a conditioning/ moisture treatment. It is a chemical treatment that repairs the damage. It actually  makes your hair more healthy by repairing bonds broken by heat, color, ponytail holders, dry brushing, environment, hard water, chlorine, etc.. My hair is mirror shiny, smooth, soft, and incredibly manageable. My curls are clumping on their own like they used to when I was a kid and I have increased shrinkage and volume. My hair is just healthy in a way it hasn’t been during my adult life.<br /><br />The directions say to apply to damp hair and leave on 10 min, then shampoo and condition. I leave it on until my hair drys which takes 2-4 hours and then I wash and condition. The extra time makes a noticeable difference in results for me. Their website says it’s safe to leave on for an long as you like, but they don’t recommend sleeping with it because it might get in your eyes. But I think you could do this with a plastic shower cap.<br /><br />Note: Olaplex 3 is CGM safe, but not all of the products from this line are. Which is a shame because I would happily spend the money on the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-ins if they didn’t have silicones.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHODNOLEXLTT37TJ6RB4YQEYRIIA,2020-10-16 13:00:40.663,0,True

1.0,Nope,Let me start this review by saying I have naturally curly hair.  Not a pretty curl but more of a frizzy curly.  I've struggled with it my whole life.  I'm 64 and have tried lots of products through the years.  In the last couple of years I've not cut my hair so it was getting well below shoulder length.  I had it cut and layered just above shoulder length.  Even after the cut it had a dry fried look to it.  My hair is not dyed or permed.  I found Olaplex on Amazon after looking at beauty product reviews online.  The reviews were good so I bought it even though it was more expensive than many other products.  First use and I'm sadly disappointed.  My hair felt dry and wiry even when wet after shampooing.  After I dried and styled my hair it felt dry and coarse.  Not like hair that had just had a deep conditioning treatment.  I will use it again just to see and maybe use more product.  It says use a generous amount and I did.  Not worth the extra $.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I thought I'd give this another try and use more product.  As previously stated I used a generous dollop the first go round.  Tried even more the 2nd time.  I applied to damp hair as instructed and let it sit for longer than the prescribed time.  Rinsed and shampooed with the same results.

5.0,Miracle Worker,This stuff is pretty amazing.  After reading the other reviews I was hesitant but my stylist recommended this so I gave it a try.  My hair was very damaged from over bleached highlights and I’ve been trying to repair it over the last year.  Nothing else worked more that being a daily detangler.  After one use of Olaplex Hair Perfector the repair was noticeable and the effects have lasted several weeks between reapplying.  At this point I’ve used it probably 6-8 times and the bottle has probably another 2-3 applications.  It’s a small bottle and pretty expensive but I think it’s worth it.  My hair feels soft and doesn’t have noticeable breakage anymore.

I have used it 4 times and have about 1/3 of the bottle left (that’s just with me applying this to my ends and then gently distributing it upwards) so it doesn't last long. I don’t think I will be reordering this because of the small amount you get for the price, I just don’t feel like it made my hair grow or stay hydrated as well as it should.

5.0,"Great for Curly, dry, porous hair","First is before treatment and different color hair, and second photo is after treatment.  After the first treatment with 3,5 and 6, I noticed a significant change….it’s like I have a different set of hair on my head!  I have color treated, curly, fine, porous hair and since using  this, I do not wash my hair as much anymore.  I wake up and it just doesn’t look dry or Like I have to wash to start with a fresh pallet to style.  It’s smooth - and not so smooth that all body has been removed.  Feels silky.  It’s just such a change, as I said, with what usually I deal with is the porous hair that is hard to smooth without removing the body.  I did try this in my kiddos hair and she said it made her hair more oily.  Her hair is only dry on ends but she said it helped the ends.  Follow the directions and leave on exactly as it’s called for.  The shampoo - minimal.  I put the shampoo in and leave on for five minutes and then add more of my own to get more lather.  Leave conditioner on 15 minutes.  (Why I am taking more baths because I don’t always have time done that) however my hair doesn’t need the daily wash either!)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OyLX8XviL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OyLX8XviL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OyLX8XviL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YIuLvoTEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YIuLvoTEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YIuLvoTEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGJT6LBFMIC4G5X6IX5FSYID2QFA,2021-12-03 17:14:14.870,0,True

4.0,Probably does what it is supposed to do,"All of my research about repairing damaged hair led me to Olaplex. I have used it once so far, and I am not impressed. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t doing what it is supposed to do. I should mention I live in a very dry climate. I wanted shinier, stronger hair that wouldn’t break as much and would freely flow. My hair feels thicker, if nothing else, but in the way volumizing shampoo would make it feel. It seems to tangle worse than before, even immediately after brushing. Though the body is smooth, the ends are still frizzy and my hair clumps together in sections. I think a Keratin treatment is more what I’m looking for. I gave this 4 stars because it is probably doing what it should be doing and would be great for someone who likes volume, but I don’t think it is what I needed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHjUR1-pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHjUR1-pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHjUR1-pL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hFNnPPboL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hFNnPPboL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hFNnPPboL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFI7STQJPUVK7UAO3EQNC2LVQBCQ,2019-11-26 18:36:58.024,0,True

5.0,Bleached Hair? Here's Your Miracle!,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I have very damaged bleached hair. If you have bleached hair and you're not using this product you will never realize how beautiful your hair will look and feel. A small amount goes a long way. I find the best way to work this product in is to tip my head upside down. Start at the tips and work up through the hair. You will immediately start feeling your hair untangle as you work this through. this eliminates having to comb your hair while it's wet and at it weakest. I then wrap it up in a shower cap and keep on for as long as I have time, sometimes hours. Then rinse and follow insturctions on package. Though the packaging is small trust me a little goes a long way, I have almost shoulder length hair and I get 5 applications from this bottle, so don't be put off about the price. It's worth every penny you spend on it.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHYCQ5ER6NFNYE52EOCXOTFDVYXA,2018-03-20 15:36:10.495,4,True
5.0,I was extremely satisfied with this product.,"This product came as advertised.  Same as the one I had from Sephora (I had read some reviews on here that it wasn't the same).  I have fine texture, shoulder length color treated hair.  This product is quite simple to use, you just totally wet your hair and towel dry it (you don't want it dripping) , apply the product throughout (I use approx 1/4 of contents for an application, a little pricey but I want to take good care of my hair).  Afterward I put a clear shower cap over my hair and do whatever about the house or catch up on some TV shows. It says to leave on for at least 10 mins, I leave in  my hair for 1-2 hours (I want to reap as much benefits of the product as I can). Afterward rinse it all out and shampoo, condition , blow dry and style as usual.  I find it makes my hair silkier, shinier and gives it body and bounce.  My hair has the I just left the salon feel after using this product.  I really like that is doesn't have a strong scent, I would describe it as pleasant but very mild.  I just snapped a pic of the back of my hair with my phone so you can see for yourself.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71z843-xsiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71z843-xsiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71z843-xsiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AE4OP62HC4RSNAF3BHCYS4RNW77A,2019-04-12 21:07:34.806,2,True

Before I started using it, my hair was straggly, thinning, and dried out from aging and from coloring it every four weeks. I was skeptical about purchasing Olaplex because practically every other product people love that I’ve tried did not work on my hair. This changed my hair instantly and so dramatically that I don’t have to use any other smoothing balm or oil on my hair, just Olaplex, shampoo, and conditioner.

Saturated my hair in anything hydrating I could- body lotion and face oils included- wrapped it up and couldn’t wait until tonight when my products arrived. This product is a miracle.

5.0,Must have for those with bleached hair,"I have been using Olaplex since it first became available. I have medium brown, fine hair texture that is tenacious. To be blonde my hair needs a 40 volume bleach for 35 minutes, so obviously my hair needs some repair occasionally. This is the best product to use for damaged hair. I have noticed that within the last 2 years Olaplex has thinned their product slightly, but it still works great. Old stock will be a little thicker. I've seen the same thinning from reputable salons in my area who sell through this product like crazy. I got tired of them being out of stock, so started ordering on amazon.<br /><br />The directions tell you to use the product before shampooing. I find the best way to use this product is to shampoo twice, towel dry hair quick, apply olaplex, leave in for 10+ minutes, quick rinse, apply your favorite conditioner, leave in for a few minutes, and rinse. There's no way this product would work for me if I didn't shampoo first. My hair needs lots of styling product and that build up needs to be removed first.<br /><br />Also, if it's your first application, you will need to use 2+ quarter size worth of olaplex. My first application after not using for a while always needs more than the reccomended amount.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFVMK2PF5MHUJODYFNN7DNSIZHSQ,2018-04-15 02:42:23.722,3,True

Not worth the money,"My hair stylist had messed up my hair after dying it, and when she fixed it by dying it a second time, it literally felt like dry hay.<br /><br />As a desperate attempt to fix my hair, I bought #0, 3, and 7 after extensive research into these products.<br /><br />Extra info: My hair is dark, thick and coarse straight-wavy Asian hair. I washed my hair and applied #0 and #3 and left the products on for ~45 minutes then washed it off.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The smell for all 3 products were really great<br />- They're easy to use<br />- Made my hair feel really soft when they were still applied<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The products were super small (see pictures for comparison). #0 and #3 would only last me 2-3 uses as I have a lot of hair<br />- My hair felt soft only when it was still wet. I felt hopeful that my hair was healed, but it went right back to being dry as hay when it was dried<br /><br />Conclusion: Not only did these products not work, they were pretty pricy at $28 a pop. I used my usual Argan Oil hair mask and that worked WAY better at a fraction of these bottles. I suggest using the other hair masks first before investing in these bottles.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cZtg6YTKS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cZtg6YTKS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1cZtg6YTKS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1z2P6UOxUS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1z2P6UOxUS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1z2P6UOxUS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AE7M45F44PGOX5RSJCN3UOG6KZYA,2021-08-07 07:23:56.334,1,True

5.0,"It's Not Cheap, But I'm Worth It!","This stuff saved my hair I went from dark brown, almost black hair to caramel highlights with chocolate lowlights in one day. The first picture shows  my hair literally from one day to the next when I first got it done 2 weeks ago. The bleaching process was brutal, and I was afraid I would end up with split ends, breakage, and hair that felt like straw. My stylist mentioned adding Olaplex to my hair color, so I figured I would look it up and see what it was. That's how I found out about the  #3 Hair Perfecter & decided to order some and try it out. The results were immediate. My ends felt hydrated and my hair was left soft and with very little shedding. This stuff is expensive, but definitely worth the cost if you are someone who colors or bleaches your hair. I simply wash my hair once, then apply it to my damp hair and let it sit for a few hours. I then wash it again and apply conditioner and allow that to sit for a while or overnight. Rinse, blow-dry, press and style, and I am good to go. This stuff allows me to achieve salon results at home without going to the salon every week for maintenance, and enables me to rock heavy highlights without worrying about damaging my hair.

5.0,Say goodbye to thin hair,"I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist and it was definitely a life changer for my bleached hair!<br /><br />During the pandemic,  salons were closed and I wasn’t able to maintain my bleached/blonde hair. I am naturally a brunette but have gone blonde/platinum for the past 4 years now. Let me be the first to tell you that blonde/platinum hair is the most high maintenance color for a natural brunette. It requires constant maintenance, hours at the salon, specific products, and lots of patience.<br /><br />A good stylist will tell you that you can’t go from brunette to blonde in one sitting. It isn’t safe for your hair and you could lose lots of your hair. So it took me over a year to get the color I wanted safely. Unfortunately when the pandemic hit I wasn’t able to go to the salon for months! So when salons finally opened again, I was desperate to get my hair back to the way it was and was willing to do whatever it took. I did a full bleach with toners as well and it took several hours. My head felt like it was on fire.<br /><br />Long story short, I lost so much of my hair after insisting on going hard core with the bleach and toner. It was very noticeable and made me feel a bit unconscious since I’ve always had nice hair. But low and behold Olaplex No 3 has saved my hair life and has helped bring my hair back to life.<br /><br />It has strengthened my very thin hair making it feel thicker and healthier. I notice almost no split ends and my hair still remains soft. Please consider this product if you have a hair story similar to mine OR if you have thinning hair.

3.0,Works well at first but the results don't last long,"Updated review: I originally gave this product 5 stars, but after a few uses I've found unfortunately that the smoothness didn't last long for my hair. I feel it does a better job of bonding my split ends but my hair goes back to being frizzy and dry the next day. I also didn't mention that I used Olaplex 0 & 3 in conjunction with a sulfate free moisturizing shampoo, moisturizing conditioner, Argan leave in conditioner, and Argan oil at the end of styling. For the price and size of the bottles I had higher expectations, but it's possible it works better on straighter hair. One more thing I noticed was that it rained for a few days where I'm from and my hair definitely began to frizz up like normal.<br /><br />First Review: I have thick wavy hair that has been frizzy my entire life. The texture of my hair comes from my mixed ethnicity (Italian & latina). Specifically after blow drying I normally have to go back over my hair with a straightener to get it smooth. The constant heat styling and recent highlighting were making my hair very dry. Even when I had virgin unprocessed hair my ends never layed flat after blow drying and have always looked like a broom lol. In the humid summers it's rare that I blow out my hair because within minutes it usually becomes  curly, wavy, and frizzy. I've used just about every popular product out there including drug store and salon brands to no avail. I've used Olaplex 3 just once along with number 0 and I saw immediate results in the texture and softness. My hair is laid and I don't have to use a straightener after. This product doesn't make your hair straight it just changes the texture, making it softer and more manageable. I can see it working well with natural air dried hair as well. This product is a game changer!",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGB4A4G5NSCI3USDNU262ZBRWDLA,2022-09-19 02:46:17.343,1,False

5.0,AMAZING STUFF!!! IT WORKS FOR ME,"Second time buying from this seller and the Olaplex is the real deal. I got it the next day with Amazon Prime Trial. This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. Restores hair beyond what u can imagine. I have just past shoulder length hair and I wash then towel dry. I apply about 2 quaters size amounts rubbing hands together and run through hair avoiding the scalp. I then apply about a dime size amount and apply the extra to the ends. Then I cover my hair in a plastic cap and either wear it around the house for a day or overnight, which works best for me. I am naturally a brunette and bleach and tone my hair to platinum myself. Since I'm not a professional, occassionally being in a rush, lazy, or just trying to do my hair in a hurry I do have areas (sometimes my ends) that gets over processed. This stuff restores it back to healthy. After that, I use once a week about a quater size when I regular shampoo ir just as needed. Sometimes I use a small amount after shampooing hair and just leave it in and blow dry, it's so light. I've read reviews and the only things I can say is if you use it correctly and actually give it time to condition your hair (the more time the better) this stuff works and way cheaper than getting an Olaplex treatment in the salon which costs $130. Highly recommend this for splits ends, damaged hair or just if you want your hair to look healthier.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GFXpXzNpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GFXpXzNpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GFXpXzNpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHD553NGLVNIID2P7ML34SSLOKXQ,2020-04-20 02:44:43.352,5,True

Here is what works for me!<br /><br />First, use a clarifying shampoo ( nothing expensive, neutrogena clarifying shampoo works great) rinse, towel dry.<br />Then apply olaplex 3. Make sure to saturate and comb it through your entire hair. I place a shower cap and wait 15-20 mins. Then rinse completely and towel dry. This stuff is to repair and not to moisturize. So you need to do a deep treatment.<br /><br />The holy grail I found is Inphenom Hair Treatment mask ( I just buy the refill and save myself 8 bucks). I add it to my hair below my scalp generously and comb it through then again with a shower cap for 30 minutes. Rinse really well! And style as usual.<br />If you really want a super silky glossy look then spray on some WOW dream coat to your damp hair before styling and that my friend will give you the most shiny, silky amazing results!

5.0,So far so good.,"I am African American and was very skeptical about using this on my hair, but after using a relaxer in November left my hair severely damaged and breaking off severely I was desperate to try something.

I am not seeing the hair loss like before and even the balding spots are growing in! It comes in a tiny bottle and my hair is very thick, so I don't use a lot, but it seems to be helping so far.

This time it's sold and shipped directly from Amazon and after ONE use, my hair totally transformed!! It's soft and shiny again!! No more dry, tangled, brittle straw-like hair. I'm so amazed and am a fan forever.

I had given up.<br /><br />I decided I’d relax it risking the chemical damage and there was a little, enough to risk length with my fine hair. The ends were so dry that they would tangle and break. This product made it as if I had always had long smooth straight healthy locks...<br /><br />And for that I am so grateful. I wear my hair down all of the time, have taken such delight in getting to know my hair and learning to style it, and feel like a new woman entirely. Thank you Olaplex. Relaxing my hair turned into a wonderfully life changing decision rather than a choppy gummy nightmare thanks to you.<br /><br />PS: I know they say it runs its course totally after 45 minutes but I feel like the result of the time I slept with it in was monumentally better than the time I washed it out after an hour.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGDEYZLVWUSD73QWXGI5BYOF7NUA,2020-05-12 10:56:03.158,0,True

I am super happy with the results I get from the #3. I've been dealing with hair damage and loss for over 4 years now and I've gone through periods of feeling like things are improving and then having what I call a hair crisis sometime later. I've determined after a few tries that the Olaplex #0 is one thing that sets off a hair crisis every time. It makes my hair a weird texture, dry, and eventually the hair snaps off. Luckily, using the #3 alone the following two weeks will improve things substantially. Second, on my biracial hair with mixed textures, I feel that the product works the best for me when I wash and condition my hair before I apply the #3 to damp/wet hair, cover with a processing cap and leave in for up to 3 hours, rinse with lukewarm or cool water and follow up with moisturizing leave-in products and sealing with hair oil as the final step. I really wasn't thrilled with the results if I followed the directions on the bottle. Third, it's best if I don't use the #3 every week. I plan to try to do a treatment once a month or when I feel like there's an increase in breakage, and hopefully I won't be overdoing it as every week application proved to be too much a good thing for my hair.<br /><br />Original review: I think this has fixed the keratin damaged hair I have been dealing with for almost 3 long years. I will be so happy if this continues and doesn't eventually lead to more hair loss like everything I've tried so far. Olaplex no.3 has given me hope.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFDFBMON46VROXV55EWLAIFJP73Q,2020-12-23 18:45:57.528,0,True

My hair is colored but is growing out. The color dried it out so much. Think fried, hay like hair that was crunchy and just not soft in the least. I tried this expensive product and it helped but the third time I used it I noticed the biggest difference! I read a few ppl say the second time works best. My hair sucked this stuff up like a sponge which sucked for me bc my hair had a lot of volume and it almost took a whole bottle to saturate the hair the first time. (I was putting it on the new growth too) not feasible and too expsensive so the 2nd bottle I only used half of it and only on the dyed parts. Same thing the third time on the dyed parts only. With a good hydrating shampoo. Biolage intense repair conditioner, a little Redken hydra melt leave in, and a little mizani coconut soufflé with a tamanu oil sealing it helped tremendously. (I was doing these things before the opalex no 3 btw) take a look at the results for yourself.

1.0,BUYER BEWARE - EXTREME HAIR LOSS WITH OLAPLEX PRODUCTS,"I started using Olaplex in April 2021 after seeing a social media post. I have lost clumps and clumps of hair and saw multiple doctors including endocrinologists, dermatologists, general practitioners, and specialty hair providers. I have spent over $5K in PRP treatments and doctor visits/lab work monthly to identify any culprit. It wasn't until I found the FB group and saw some recent articles from OlaPlex users experiencing the same thing! My hair stylist would always have tears in her eyes from washing my hair and seeing how much would fall out and would beg me to get answers. And here we are, it took 7 months for my hair to stop falling out after using this horrible product line. FB group is: Olaxplex Hair Loss/Hair Damage.<br /><br />PLEASE be cautious if you continue to use or want to purchase. Some of the users only had used the product 1-3x and experienced massive clots of hair gone (with pictures). Don't let hair stylist who make commission tell you that you weren't using it right OLAPLEX says it's for everyday use for their shampoo/conditioner. Clearly not only is that not the case, but there is something in their proprietary formula that causes loss from the root and breakage mid length - not even at the ends.

There bonds are broken any time we apply chemicals and/or heat and the damage intensifies if you are not caring for your hair by giving it the proper moisture and maintenance. This Olaplex will help repair that damage but the stove ingredients do not provide the exact same thing as deep conditioners.<br /><br />Also, think about this before you buy, as many people have complained about the price being so expensive for what you get.

5.0,Saved my bleached out hair mess,"Quick backstory: I purchased the Olaplex holiday hair kit (no. 3-7) about a year ago when everyone was raving about these products. At the time I had been growing out my natural hair for awhile and hadn’t colored or chemically processed in over 5 years. I used it a few times and didn’t really notice a difference from my normal products so I shoved them in the back of my bathroom closet and forgot about it. Fast forward to recent times I decided I wanted to start coloring again. First appointment with the stylist I got some natural highlights. Second appointment I was ready for something more dramatic so we went heavy on the foil highlights and then had a gloss over top. The first time I washed my hair afterwards I knew there was a problem. My hair felt like limp straw while wet and as soon as I started washing it bunched up into horrible matted balls at the ends. It took forever to comb it out and after blow drying I was left with dry, frizzy, obviously very damaged hair. About a week and two more horrible washing experiences later, a friend recommended Olaplex and the lightbulb finally went off. I pulled the kit from out of the closet and low and behold! After the first use my hair was probably 75% improved. By the second use my hair was restored to all its former glory! One thing to keep in mind is that the products are very concentrated so if you use too much it can cause a bit of greasiness. Bottom line: I think this is a great product for damaged hair but may not be worth it if you have average hair already.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFDP6NHDNGWRJ5RYEKYMAXMSBYBA,2021-01-09 21:18:23.227,0,False
1.0,Started with dryness- ended up with chunks of broken off hair.,"I see that there are many positive reviews for this product, but also several negative reviews.  My experience was negative.  I started off with some dryness.  I was hoping this product would give me a smoother, silkier look like in some of the photos.  I've been lightening my hair for quite some time and touch up my roots every few weeks (I haven't dyed the length of my hair for a long time.)  I started using this once a week letting it sit on my damp hair for about 20 minutes before washing, deep conditioning and drying/styling as usual.  At first I thought it looked like it was making some small improvements.  And then…. my hair started breaking off.  I was in denial about it being the Olaplaex so I kept using it.  And things got worse.  Now I have a 3-4"" layer of broken off hair on the top layer.  It looks awful.  It's so obvious… I can't hide it unless I wear my hair up (difficult since my hair isn't very long.)  I cannot believe the breakage and damage this product has caused.  I figured the negative reviews were nonsense since there were so many positive reviews.  I think this can work for some, but for others it fries their hair off and causes irreversible damage.  In my opinion, it's not worth taking the gamble unless you're okay with all of your hair breaking off.  Maybe it'll work well for you.  Maybe you'll end up with a fried mullet.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEMADIWSPKITVBPDIFZFB5MINDMA,2020-04-01 16:18:50.810,17,True
5.0,GREAT product (if used as intended)!,"I have been processing and bleaching my hair for 3 years now and just recently went as blonde as my hair would allow. My stylist did a fabulous job. However, I was not aware of the amount of care it took to keep bleached / processed hair healthy. I started having breakage around the neckline and went into a panic. I started googling frantically and considered all the drastic options. I have naturally dry, coarse, and thick hair that is relaxed as well as bleached... not sure how I even have hair left on my head after that sentence lol.<br /><br />This product has given me hope! Olaplex no.3 IS NOT A CONDITIONER. It’s goal is NOT to condition or soften your hair, but to bond it. There’s a major difference. I apply it to dampened hair (split into 4 sections, using a large grape size of the product per section) and leave it in for up to an hour. Beyond an hour, the product has no effect and can even be drying. Do not leave in overnight. I am now able to comb through my hair without fear of it breaking off - this is only possible with a combination of conditioning and hydrating your hair after bonding it. I am able to do 5 different treatments out of each bottle. This product alone is GREAT, but I would suggest finding your perfect combination of products to support your hair type.<br /><br />My combination that has helped my hair recover -<br />Olaplex no.3 (once a week)<br />It’s a 10, deep conditioner (once a week)<br />Redken Frizz Dismiss shamp/cond (once a week)<br />Pure Coconut Oil on dry hair (twice a week)<br />Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum (daily)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-ijRpCIVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-ijRpCIVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-ijRpCIVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHJSOSWXIAGS2LFLL6SQCGHZR74Q,2019-12-28 16:43:32.509,10,True
5.0,"Miracle for damaged hair, breakage, and split ends","This stuff is gold. I have fine, long hair but lots of it. It's been colored many times and I recently transitioned from a brunette back to my natural ash blonde with a blonde balayage. Needless to say my hair was not happy and I had tons of split ends even after getting the salon olaplex treatment. I was told by my hairdresser to try this at home and it works. The trick is to put it on damp, towel dried hair and leave it for like an hour. I put it through by bleached ends only where the damage is (makes the product last and saves $$), clip it into a bun, and put a plastic shower cap over it so it doesnt dry out. People complain that it dries out their hair or makes it unmanageable but this is NOT a conditioner. After rinsing the product out, hair needs to be shampooed AND conditioned.  I use a pretty heavy conditioner in the ends by Aspen Kay that is a bar conditioner and the two leaves my hair really soft and manageable. It took about 4 treatments before my hair felt like it did before the bleaching and I did a treatment 2x a week and I wash my hair once every 3 days or so. Now I'm only doing a treatment once every week or two. Super happy with this product and will continue to buy!

I compared the consistency between the 2 in my hands and the bottle I bought at Dermstore was so much thicker that I had to shake it to get the contents out, while the Amazon one poured out easily.

5.0,It’s a 10/10 for me…,"This is my first product review I’ve ever written on Amazon and I’ve been a prime member for many years… that right there should tell you something. I had to write a review because I was so skeptical. I’m a natural brunette but I’ve been a bright blonde for several years. In 2019 I underwent chemotherapy for breast cancer and ultimately had to shave my head. It’s taken me 3 years to get it past my shoulders. I’ve only cut it 2 times. The ends were so healthy and my hair was twice as thick as it was prior to chemo. My virgin hair came back better than ever. We started bleaching it again when it was almost at chin length. We started out slowly introducing highlights back into it and put more in every 4-5 weeks until I was a bright bra blonde again with super healthy hair. Fast forward to now, I’ve been diagnosed now with Lymphoma. Currently, my hair is past my shoulders, about half way between my and the middle of my back. The ends are still healthy and it split, however they’re extremely dry. And the mid-lengths are starting to break off. It’s not terrible… YET. But it’s noticeable. I had my hair done 2 weeks ago and my stylist told me I didn’t lift as well as I always have, even after she toned it, it was still brassy. She told me to get Olaplex 3-5 and use the 3 a couple times a week, and use 4 & 5 every time I shampoo. Not to use anything else for awhile. She told me to get the 4P. Which is the purple Olaplex shampoo, which just recently was launched. I was skeptical. I honestly didn’t see HOW this was going to fix my dry, brittle hair, especially being sick again with Lymphoma now. My immune system isn’t functioning at its peak and my body is generally unwell. I used these 3 products just one time… ONE TIME, y’all! And oh my god. This s*it is comparable to that of a magical unicorn. It’s a literal miracle in 3 bottles. DO NOT hesitate in trying it. I swear to you, it’s like I have completely transformed my hair in one use from this bottle of pure amazingness. You will not be disappointed.

HOWEVER, whatever this stuff is worked lmao. I have curly hair and made a very impulsive decision to bleach my hair (at a salon luckily) a week ago. My stylist did a really good job but my curls still got damaged and were loose/frizzy no matter what I did. I got this stuff, did the treatment for about 50 minutes, and then washed my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner. Long story short, my curls came back!!! They are still a little less defined than they were before I bleached it, but I’m hoping that if I continue to use the treatment they’ll come back fully within a few weeks. I don’t know if I’ll be buying from here again just because I’m still not totally sure it’s Olaplex and I’d rather spend $28 on their actual website, but whatever is in the bottle I got here actually fixed my hair and I’m so happy!!",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFNN4UA4SNOQQ6F4JSISDH6I3EMA,2021-04-23 22:21:16.750,0,True

I'm glad I did! It's so easy and the results are AMAZING. I noticed the difference the moment I got out of the shower... but the real test was going to be the next morning when I'd style it.  I curled it and loved the results... Olaplex left my hair silky soft, bouncy and healthy after just one use.

5.0,Brings life back to your hair!,"I bought this product (Olaplex 0 + number 3) in an attempt to restore life to my dry and brittle hair. I have extremely thick hair (enough to cover 4 average heads of hair) so I have to use more than most. That being said, this product lasted me 4 uses when combined with the number 0.<br /><br />I applied the number 0, waiting 15 minutes and then applied the number 3 directly on top. I let it stay in my hair 2 full hours, then rinsed, shampoo and conditioned. My hair was visibly better after the first use! I researched and saw that others use it overnight and I figured why not. I’ve been leaving it on 24-48 hours and find that it works so much better when left on longer. Olaplex says it can be left on overnight, but we should be careful not to get the product in our eyes.<br /><br />My methods are:<br />If using Olaplex 0+number 3, I will apply the 0 to clean and dry hair, wait for 10-15 minutes and then apply the number 3 right on top. Leave on for 24 hours, rinse, shampoo, and condition. Allow hair to air dry.<br /><br />If using only Olaplex number 3, I apply to damp/towel dried (not wet) hair. Comb through from roots to tip and leave on 24-48 hours. Rinse, shampoo, and condition - then allow hair to air dry.<br /><br />The scent is mild and not overwhelming, but it’s smells good. This is extremely moisturizing to my hair.<br /><br />I recommend for anyone who has bleach, color, chemical/heat damage to their hair. It is a miracle worker!<br /><br />I purchased this product and was not paid to use it or leave any reviews. I have purchased 2 more to use in the future.

5.0,Exactly what my hair needed!,"If you have high porosity, natural, textured hair, I highly recommend this! I'm very excited about this treatment. It feels like a conditioner when applied (although it is NOT), and when I washed it out an hour later, my hair felt obviously in better condition. My strands were clearly smoother, shinier and easier to comb through. I plan to use this especially for the bottom half of my hair because that gets the most breakage. I have about 10"" of afro-textured hair and used about half a bottle. Maybe I was heavy handed, but I see myself using this continually once a month or every 6 weeks to make sure my hair is as strong as possible. I also alternate between henna glosses and cassia treatments as my deep conditioners on other weeks. I use rice water, flaxseed gel-I'm a super diy natural hair advocate. But sometimes you do need to fill in the cracks with the power of chemistry. This just fills in anything missing in my routine for repair. It doesn't mess with anything else I'm personally doing, although I have 10 years experience with my natural hair (3 big chops, know how to make my hair grow quickly). I'm definitely fitting this into my routine. My hair looks and feels AMAZING! Excited to see how this will help my hair over the long term which seems like where you'd see the biggest benefit. Try it! They have trial kits if you're not sure. But at least N°3 is worth spending the money on.

I was worried it was fake so I ended up purchasing another bottle through Sephora rather than risk it. It's pretty hard to tell the bottles apart but the one on the right is Sephora's.  There's some minor differences with the labels including the Sepora label is a lot more crisp, has bold font, and generally looks way more legitimate. It's also a lot thicker of consistency and has a yellow tint to it unlike the Amazon one. Sephora's fragrance was much stronger too.<br /><br /> I thought the Amazon one was okay but not worth the price. Then I tried the Sephora one and... wow what a difference it made! It worked 10x better than the Amazon one and made my hair so incredibly soft and shiny. Don't be fooled by this one. Do yourself a favor and go straight through Sephora.

The only thing I would say is that I had to find what works for me in terms of the method. The instructions insist that it should be washed off with shampoo but that did NOT work for me - my hair is frizzy and it looked as if my hair got even frizzier (if thats possible). So what I do now is wash with shampoo and apply the corrector and leave fo a few hours or overnight. In the morning I wash it off with water (no shampoo) and condition as well. This works great for me. I used their conditioner but I dont think that makes a big difference. I also noticed that if I stop using it my hair goes back to its 'damaged' state within a few days so it doesn't last too long. But then I straighten everyday.

5.0,Amazing Results!!,"My hair was severely damaged!  I home color every month for the last 20 years. I use heat on my hair daily.  And I live near the ocean and scuba dive or swim every few days.  I deep condition once every week or two weeks and my hair was so dry, brittle, stringy, and knotty.<br />I primed with Olapalex no. 0 for 15 mins and then coated with Olaplex no. 3 for 15 minutes 2 days ago.

I wanted to have the salon treatment of no. 1 & 2, but I'm a travel nurse and headed back to The Virgin Islands in a few days, so I'm just out of time to wait for an appointment this go around.  I colored my hair today and ""cheated"" by using Bond Angel by Brae .01 and added it to my home color.  Then rinsed off my color and used the second step of the Bond Angel kit.  I followed the directions and left it on my hair in the shower for 15 mins. I then used Olaplex shampoo and conditioner and Oh. My. Goodness!!!!  My hair feels amazing!!! It is so healthy!  I blow dried and curled my hair after I applied my normal leave in treatment and Chi serum and it hasn't felt this strong, silky and healthy in forever!!!!  If you're debating, don't!  It's relatively inexpensive and is easy to do on your own hair at home and the results are simply astounding!  My daughter's hair is mildly damaged and I'm starting her on it, too!

After the product has absorbed, I thoroughly rinse my hair followed by a shampoo & application of a hair mask. Olaplex suggests using their products for best results but I use my favorite Pureology & Kerastase products as they’ve worked well for me in the past.

3.0,Instructions for Olaplex No 3!,"Hi, I wanted to write this review on Amazon, even though I purchase this from Sephora (so I do not know if the ones on Amazon are authentic.) however, I want to say THIS IS NOT A HAIR MASK TREATMENT And it SHOULD BE USED WITH ONE!!! If you use this as a standalone product, it will not help your hair!!! These are the best instructions that worked for me:<br /><br />1) wash hair with protein building shampoo and conditioner. If you recently dyed, permed, heat or chemically processed your hair - the proteins in your hair is broken down!!! You should be looking for products that say: protein, keratin, repairing, restoring. STAY AWAY from products that say moisturizing, hydrating, deep conditioning or anything similar - because your hair is damaged and won’t hold any moisture. You must first repair the protein bonds in your hair!!!<br /><br />2) put Olaplex no 3 on semi-damp hair after shower. Put a shower cap on your head to stimulate a sauna effect so that your scalp heat can open up pores and absorb product easier. Leave on for 1 hour. Olaplex no 3 only works on wet hair.<br /><br />3) wash out Olaplex, or you can choose to spray your hair damp again. Apply a HAIR MASK that contains protein or keratin. I recommend L’Oréal, which is only a couple dollars at Target or Amazon. Leave on for 20 mins (minimum) to 1 hour (ideal.) this helps to seal your bonds and provide more softer hair.<br /><br />4) wash out hair. You can use a final sealant such as a light argan or Moroccan oil. Air dry. Or also use heat protectant and blow dry.<br /><br />5) do this 1x a week. also every other week, follow up alone a deep conditioning hair mask. Look up moisture vs protein on google. But generally if your hair is damaged it is high porosity hair, which requires more protein.<br /><br />You will thank me later!!! I promise this works if you have damaged hair!!!

5.0,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!,"I had taken my teenage daughter to a salon to have her Virgin hair split dyed. She's a natural Brunette or Dark Dirty blonde whichever you see it as. She was getting one side black one side blonde.. the hair dresser was highly recommended for her dying process. So after 300$ bucks for her hair the blonde side of my daughter's hair was literally broken off and completely damaged. I felt so awful because her hair lengths didn't match. I bought the entire olaplex system as that's what a couple different salons recommended to me. We had used the entire system twice a week for 1 month. It did absolutely wonderful things for her hair. I was so impressed that I had used some on my hair because i box dye mine. It felt amazing!!!! Sadly it didn't last as long as I had hoped. I just assumed ""More is better"" when applying to her hair. But reallly you only need alittle bit and it goes a long way!<br /><br />I will be purchasing the entire system once again to do mine and my daughter's hair just to help heal the heat damage, environmental damage and mine from being box dyed so many times.

Next morning lightly shampooed and did a repair conditioning mask for 15 minutes (Joico K-pak Color Therapy Luster Lock, my holy grail of conditioning if you're interested, my hair type is thick and straight).

4.0,Good,I used most of the product by now and found it helps my hair but not a huge amount. I have moderately damaged hair and it has greatly improved the appearance for a short while after each use which is fine.

3.0,"Not moisturizing, more of a sealer. Like a glaze","I ordered a whole gift set directly from olaplex. I got the no 3, the shampoo & the conditioner & the oil. I have to say….these are …NOT … moisturizing…… At all.  In any way. I only have gotten highlights on virgin hair , just twice. I bought this as a preventative treatment because I noticed my face framed pieces were a bit crispy after my stylist put me under the heat dryer last time.  After using them all together as directed my hair was a giant tangled mess afterwards.  It was in no way moisturized and tangle free where I could run my fingers through it like when I use my normal Aveda conditioner. The first time i used it…I decided to  let my hair air dry after seeing the condition of its tangles and it felt so unconditioned.  After air drying ,it seemed a little smoother and a little shine, but the ends felt  dry.  After using the olaplex products , my honest opinion is I wish I had not wasted my money. They are definitely not for added moisture or conditioning. It’s just something like a temporary gloss or glaze to kote the hair. To give a temporary smooth feeling, but It seems to actually prevent moisture getting into the hair after using it until it’s slowly washed out. So it makes the hair dryer. In my opinion. It’s all hype. Don’t fall for a temporary …faux ….result.  Your hair needs real moisture to recover from damage . This coating prevents moisture from entering once it’s applied.  I won’t buy it again. I do not recommend ……..a temporary solution… that causes more problems in the long run.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHDHERKWELCAROPIQKDQKJ4XEXBQ,2021-10-22 01:57:48.685,0,False

During quarantine, I have been jade green/ northern highlights to uber blonde but is now pale blonde/blush pink and I can still run my fingers through it.

5.0,The best bonding treatment I’ve tried out of several,"I can’t say enough positive things about this. It literally saved my hair. I tried several other bond repair treatments prior to using this because other reviewers were saying it’s not that great, but it is. My hair had been over processed from years passed, two current treatments of color oops and a current bleach wash (even though I have level 4/5 ask brown hair). My hair was rough to say the least. Touching it would make you cringe. Literally straw. In December I had 8” cut after the recent treatments I did and I vowed to get my hair healthy again for good and grow it back. Even deep conditioning and the other bonding treatments didn’t help as drastically as olaplex did. I always had these patches, especially on the side, that looked like they were dead ends, except they weren’t. (You know those frizzy, dead looking things more towards the top of your head)...yeah. So, I bought this. I used it once a week for now one month. My hair is now baby soft. No exaggeration. No frizz, no dryness, no dead ends...nothing. My stylist said it is soooo much healthier. I keep asking her to trim it and she keeps saying there is just no need for it especially since I’m trying to grow it back. I seriously can’t even remember the last time my hair has been this healthy! My bottle isn’t even empty yet and I am VERY liberal with it. (My hair is just past my shoulders right now but thinner). I leave in for one hour (after shampooing and conditioning) and follow with a deep conditioner after every use. I will most likely purchase another bottle after this one and continue the process for at least a few months. I should have thought to take a before pic and will add one if I can find one that counts.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q8A63oI-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q8A63oI-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q8A63oI-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEF4OPMBE5L6UKI3C4NAQDEE56TA,2020-02-12 19:44:07.485,1,True

5.0,For damaged hair this is a must.,"I'm usually very skeptical when purchasing hair products, especially if they say 'repair' as once hair is damaged there is very little to do aside from cut it off, I take great care of my hair both with deep conditioning masks as well as at home oil treatments and what not, but again my hair had been permed and damaged and even with my treatments I was barely able to maintain the current health of it rather then reverse the damage, or as stated earlier just chopping it off, however, after a single use of this olaplex that was gifted to me, I saw a significant dip in my brittle ends.

3.0,Not a knock off but Not a miracle either,"I want everyone who has damaged hair to be able to manage it without cutting it off so please read! I have used olaplex 3 three times within a few weeks. I did the recommended 10min the first time, 40min the second time, and over night the third time. The results for each time were the same. Please listen to this part and take it to heart because I want you to be happy! My results were very nice. My hair before treatment was extremely dry and the damage was so bad that when my hair was wet it would stretch very long and break off. When I would wake up in the morning my hair would be SO frizzy and puff out like an afro. It was Really bad you guys. After the treatments, my hair would no longer frizz over night and my split ends like very nice after olaplex as well. I have breakage along my part and the end would frizz and be very bifocal but after the treatments my ends looked really great. HOWEVER. The stretching did not improve whatsoever and that is what causes the most breakage which is why we want this product to begin with! It did not strengthen my hair at all. It did make it very nice looking and it did make my hair manageable and stopped the dry frizz that would happen literally every night no matter what. So yes this will make your hair look nice and feel better temporarily, but it will not repair it. HOWEVER again, so not dispare! There IS a product that WILL strength your hair! It is called Aphogee 2 Step Protein Treatment. It costs $5 for a pack at Sallys. I used this for the second time today after giving olaplex a try, and after one Treatment I have the same great benefits from the olaplex such as my ends looking nice and my hair being manageable BUT THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS! This 2step Treatment also made my hair Extremely less stretchy, I can pull it and it does not stretch and snap unless I really tan on it whereas before if I touched my wet hair, pieces would break off right away. The Aphogee Treatment is $5, you only need it twice a month at the most, and it not only makes your hair look great and feel nice and thick, it also strengthens your hair to where it will not snap off whereas it still snapped off for me with this extremely expensive olaplex. Please just buy the Aphogee, a lot of others are saying this too and the only reason I am not bald and sad is because I listened to them, please listen too!",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AE5XASCFZJLJWXSATZP5CLWEYOKA,2020-10-22 17:49:56.804,1,True

5.0,Olaplex works!,"Just last week I singed my hair using a defective curling iron.<br /><br />Admittedly, I did hear a faint click when using the curling iron, but paid no mind - to my detriment!  I'd only had the unit a month, and always keep it at a low temperature (I am a ginger and while plentiful my hair is very fine).  This weekend an electrician friend checked the unit, and confirmed it did malfunction, quickly going up to very, very hot, despite being set at low.<br /><br />I saw my stylist who cut away obvious singed areas (happily limited to the ends) where is pretty much the ares that made contact - the ends.  I have used curling irons forever and this has NEVER happened before.<br /><br />My stylist recommended Olaplex No. 2 (funny as her workplace sells all sorts of Purology products).  Amazon carried it, so I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived the very next day [yesterday].<br /><br />Well, today was the FIRST application (wash and rinse - apply Olaplex  - let stay in for 10 minutes and rinse).  I can absolutely see and feel the difference.  I had not expected to actually see a difference after only one use, but there it was, a softness from roots to ends.<br /><br />Olaflex recommends using the product for truly damaged hair - over processed, over dyed - it be used three times a week, and after repairs are observed, just once weekly.<br /><br />It's expensive for sure, but absolutely works.<br /><br />P.S.

Just got back to my hair stylist about 3 weeks later (pic 2/3) and we did a roof shadow and a toner to smooth her out. My hair is still trash because it’s so short, but omg this seriously is amazing!

5.0,Better than the bottle from Sephora,"First things first, I have fine, short, frizzy/curly, damaged hair that I heat style about 3 times a week and color maybe once every 3-4 months.<br /><br />I wanted to make sure I waited a little while before I wrote this, because I wanted to make sure it actually worked as well as I thought it did. And I'm happy to report it's that good and better.<br /><br />I've used Olaplex no 3 about 6 or 7 times now (that's just under 2 bottles for me because my hair is short and fine). I've purchased from Sephora online (my local stores dont carry it) and from Amazon. I was worried about buying from Amazon because you honestly never know what/who you're buying from, and there would be no way to know it was fake until it was too late. This bottle smells EXACTLY like the bottle I got from Sephora, and they were almost the same color. However, the sephora bottle was EXTREMELY RUNNY. Like, to the point I had a hard time putting it in my hair because it was just sliding right off. It was the first time I had used the stuff, so I thought maybe that was normal and I just had to learn the technique. It worked okay, took about 3 times before I really saw any results beyond just being kinda softer.<br /><br />Now this stuff... I hadn't done an Olaplex treatment in about a month (cause I'm broke folk) but I've still been heat styling my hair AND did 1 color deposit treatment. So I was going into this with pretty jacked up hair, and honestly this stuff worked even better than the bottle I got from Sephora. And I got it on prime day so for about 1/3 the price, so there was pretty much good feelings all around!<br /><br />I know some people have complained about receiving fake product, but that wasn't the case with me. Maybe it was a fluke, or the bottle I got from Sephora was bad, but either way I'm so very happy with this purchase and i will be buying from Amazon again.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AG7LPLAYXGAUTSVJOQ63M76VONLA,2019-07-31 19:02:52.085,2,True

1.0,DO NOT BUY - HAIR LOSS after using olaplex only 2 times!,"I never write reviews but: I'm so upset - my hair is majorly falling out since using the product ONLY TWICE! It's been 3.5 weeks and still happening. I counted today 170+ hairs WAY MORE than I ever lost.  I used Olaplex years ago over periods of time in the past and never had a problem with it. I now had re-ordered it here and I don't know if they changed the formula, if its a scam or if it's just a random occurrence for some who use it, but same is happening to people who bought the product on Sephora, they even started a self help group and maybe want to sue! I used it only twice (once a week) and my hair is crazily falling out since then. I never had this issue at any point in my life or from anything! I'm not allergic to ANYTHING.  I'm actually concerned to even shower or brush my hair right now, and it's way more than the amount of hair I usually lose naturally! I obviously will stop using it from now on, but I'm shocked to also have found so many reviews here, and even forums online and on Facebook where many many women face hair loss from olaplex, some up to 50% and more of their entire hair! I just hope it stops soon for me but I recommend to NOT BUY olaplex anymore cause it's just not worth it if it goes wrong and your hair starts falling out!!!! Picture: 100+ hairs I lost double after showering and air drying I can go through my hair and just pull them out without pulling!

I have super fine, naturally blonde hair that was curly as a kid but became very dry and frizzy- I had extensive heat damage due to using a hair straightener every single day and sleeping w wet hair basically every night. After five years of nonstop heat, my hair was so brittle and dry it would literally fall apart in my hands. I decided to try olaplex and I am SO glad I did- my hair finally feels healthy again for the first time in years. I use 3 roughly once a week for an hour or two at a time, and after just a few weeks I am seeing the biggest differences in my hair. My curls are coming back and my frizz is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I highly recommend this product to anyone, specifically those with heat damage. I know it doesn’t work for everyone, but I think the key is to not overuse it - I use 3 once a week and use 4 and 5 about 3-4 times a week.

1.0,Sodium lauryl sulfate,Worked well for a little while then I notice my hair drying out as if I was using cheap shampoos. I then realized it contains Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).

5.0,Best Hair Product Ever,"I am 63 years young.  My hair is long and has never been treated with dyes just wash and wear.  The past couple of years my hair has had a lot of breakage I am guessing due to aging.  I have tried many hair products to reduce breakage to no avail.  I was in fear of having to cut my hair short, no no no!  As a very last resort I tried Olaplex No 0, No 3, No 4, and No 5 regiment.  After using the conditioner I towel dry and add a drop or two of argon oil (be sure to use a wet brush).  The breakage has stopped.  My hair is soft, smooth, and not frizzy.  I am so happy with the results.  My hair is beautiful again.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AE5XC5A53JBRGXSPSS4ZM5YUMWVA,2020-12-04 16:48:41.103,0,True

1.0,Break dancing Hair!,"I left a bleaching formula on my roots way too long about a year and a half ago. It began breaking off so I finally got professional help which resulted in my hair being cut off from mid-back length to not even touching my shoulders.  It's been ""babied"" back to health and I've been able to have my roots professionally lightened about every seven weeks. I still have a spot on my right front side that was extremely damaged, gummy, crinkly and porous that continued to break off some until within the last 4-5 months, during which time it  had normalized for the most part and was finally growing out. The rest of my hair appeared to be normal and my root touch-ups were going well. My stylist, between touch-ups, did an Olaplex treatment using #3, the shampoo and the leave-in conditioner. To be fair, though I thought it made my hair a bit coarse, I didn't, after this first treatment, notice any breakage although it seemed like I had more ""fly-aways"" near my scalp. My stylist advised waiting a few weeks and using the #3 at home before doing another root touch-up.  All was going well and about three weeks after my last root touch-up I used the  Olaplex 3 and left it on about an hour. Within two days the sides and front of the left side of my hair had completely broken off and the problem right side (which had been growing out)  was crinkling up and clearly had broken off some more. Everywhere else, more hair than usual came out in my brush. I can't blame the last root-touch up as the cause -- it had been weeks since I'd had one and my hair had been ok until I used the Olaplex.  I am back to square one and my hair is worse than it was over a year and a half ago. I won't use any Olaplex or other bonding products again.  Though it may work wonders for most, the potential for severe breakage, especially for blondes, isn't, in my opinion, worth the risk.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEOZVEGYQ23TXW3IH5P5KDIWPSQQ,2022-07-24 21:12:11.806,0,False

2.0,Didn't Work For Me,"After doing a lot of online ""research"" I landed on Olaplex. My goal is to help my severely damaged hair after 2 rounds of bleaching. I know there is no way to know if this is the ""real"" Olaplex, but I compared my bottle to the online pictures of the one on the actual Olaplex website, and everything is exactly the same including the ingredients.<br /><br />I saw lots of great reviews here, of many women saying this helped their hair, even after just one use, so I felt really hopeful.  Also watched many YouTube videos of women showing how it helped their hair.<br /><br />This literally has done 0 for my hair. I've used it twice, left it on for 30 minutes each time, and nothing. It's like I didn't even put anything in my hair. I wasn't expecting a miracle overnight, but to discern not even the smallest amount of difference after 2 treatments just seems really amiss to me. So disappointing after biting the bullet and spending the $28 for such a small amount of product.<br /><br />I am moving on to a couple of other products some friends mentioned, and praying those can help my hair.

5.0,Miracle hair product when you use it the right way,"Miracle hair product when you use it the right way! After a ton of research I ordered this to repair my hair that had multiple coloring and was processed several times. Before Olaplex my hair was brittle with a lot of split ends. I could brush it and it would be tangled a few minutes later. It also felt limp and dull. I started using it after my last balayage in an attempt to preserve the length. Here’s what I did and what made it work for me:<br /><br />- The bottle is small but if you apply it damp hair a small amount will saturate and cover all hair. I have long hair (mid-way down my back) that is fine but I have a lot of it and 1 bottle lasts for 8 once weekly treatments<br /><br />- I followed Olaplex’s instructions for time which is to leave on 10 minutes. I see in other reviews that some people leave it on for hours or over night and that may work but I trust Olaplex’s instructions- they created it and know how it best works.<br /><br />- I see a lot of negative reviews saying their hair wasn’t soft or silky after use. It won’t be with use of Olaplex alone which is supposed to build the hair bond- NOT condition. I leave it on for 10 minutes then shampoo and use a hair mask. That’s how you maximize using it. If your hair is damaged like mine you can’t expect one use of Olaplex to magically repair the damage that took sometimes years to create. It’s a gradual process but it is so worth it.

5.0,This Works!,"Subscriber's wife here. I purchased Olaplex numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 together to hopefully repair severely damaged hair. I had been bleaching it to get rid of years of almost black box die and my hair was a hot mess. I was almost to the point of shaving it off and starting over. Purchased the Olaplex bond repair, shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner and I could see a remarkable difference after just one use! Was nervous to order these products online because of reviews that said they didn't get what they thought was the legit product, or that the product wasn't sealed and spilled in the box. Each of my products came either plastic wrapped, taped, and all had the safety seals intact. HIGHLY recommend the Olaplex line of hair repair products! :)",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AG6ZMN3LJTDOBCMBBW3P7NCLT3VQ,2022-04-01 16:57:56.575,0,True

Once it dried there was a noticeably big difference in my hair. I’ve tried plenty of hair masks but none have left results like these on just one use.

3.0,Underwhelming for this virgin 2b/c,"For those who are wondering, I used this on undyed hair with some dryness at the ends. My hair is coarse and kind of wiry, almost to my waist and around a 2b or c curl pattern. If I let it air-dry without moving much (like going to sleep), usually it turns out nicely after I shake it out - which is why I don't have much of a hair routine. My strand test of ~20 minutes yielded minimal results, but I moved on anyway.<br /><br />After using Olaplex once for 30 minutes: When drying, it frizzed significantly more than usual, as if each strand either weighed less or separated more from the others. Is this the ""quick-drying"" feature messing with me? After drying, my curls look a touch more relaxed than usual - not my preference. As far as the health of my hair, it looks about the same, so I'd rule that inconclusive without further testing. It's not really shinier or silkier, but might be stronger.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say I'm fairly unimpressed. If it doesn't show any difference over the next day or so, I may give it one more try. As it is, I think that I gain more from occasionally putting coconut oil in my hair. If this is helpful, let me know and I'll post an update.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AH7OMVQNLE6RX4LZRLHZOMFMOTCQ,2019-09-12 21:35:17.035,1,False

1.0,Hair falling out in clumps,"My hairdresser began using Olaplex on my hair several years ago when I'd have highlights, typically 3 - 4 times a year.  I have also purchased #3 in July of this year to use in between hair appointments but have only done so on a few occasions. I used the product in August, and my hair looked fuller & healthier.  I used it again around the end of November and noticed a lot more shedding when I'd shower.  At the time, I didn't equate the shedding to Olaplex.  I used it again on 12/20.  As I was rinsing it out, I noticed a lot of hair in my drain.  I ran my hand through my hair a large clump of hair came out.  Additional strands continued to come out while rinsing the product out. The majority of the hair loss is at my temples and crown.  It's absolutely horrible.  I went through chemotherapy in 2018 and never lost this much hair at one time during chemo.  I have joined a FB group of over 3.5k users who have also had issues with Olaplex. Based on others experiences, I'll likely continue to lose hair for some period of time.  I've been reading through the posts on FB, hoping to find a solution, but I'm not too optimistic. I'm terrified to wash my hair again as I'll be bald at the temple and portions of the crown if I continue to lose hair at the rate I did with the last wash.  I've always used the product according the Olaplex's recommendations and haven't changed products or had any life changes.  I know many people have had wonderful results with Olaplex and I did too for a while but truly wish I'd never used.

I thought of giving it another try today to see the result and the same thing happened (see photo). It may not look like a lot of hair but I really have thin hair so every strand that falls off is a big deal to me. I regularly use biotin, I brush my hair gently, don't color it anymore nor do I use hair dryers/hair irons, or any other hot tools on my hair. I'm going to give this product a rest for a while and maybe try it again in a few months to see if there's been any positive change in terms of the quality but for now, I'm a little scared that by continuing to use the product, it might do the opposite.

It is 1000000% not a fault in consumers and all the claims that this causes more damage is true. When I get my hair done my hairdresser ONLY touches up my virgin roots so the chances of my hair getting over processed are very slim. My hair was NOT falling out prior to the use of Olaplex, and now is snapping in various places and coming out in brushfulls. I haven’t changed anything else in my routine except using Olaplex. I wore it overnight which apparently is okay to do, as it’s stated on the bottle and online. Low and behold, my hair is now very dry, and extremely tangled to the touch, and better yet, when it gets wet, it’s acting as if it’s been over processed, which to those who say it’s the bleached hair to blame, I have not had my hair done in months, even if damage was the culprit, AND my hair was not falling out prior to using.

I knew going into this that this was not a conditioning mask or anything like that, so I knew that my hair wasn't going to feel newly replenished after one use.<br /><br />First use: I followed the directions EXACTLY as directed on the bottle. I left this stuff in my hair for several hours, shampooed and conditioned as normal. I noticed that I had less breakage than I usually do. I also noticed that my conditioner did its job better. My hair after one use definitely felt stronger and softer, yet it wasn't fully repaired yet. The bottle does say to use 3 to 4 times a week. This is necessary if you have severely overprocessed hair.<br /><br />I have used this 4 times already and I am almost done with the bottle and my hair feels like hair now.

3.0,Not a Miracle Cure but it Moisturizes,"[[VIDEOID:969f3944c09b1a6b377c9a88b9a5bb3c]] See my video for a walkthrough from start to finish.  At the time of this review, my color treated, naturally frizzy hair was not damaged, just dry with the ends feeling rough and especially dry despite fancy deep conditioners.  I’m growing my hair out To donate again so I won’t Be getting many trims. The ends needed help because they were heading to splitsville if I didn’t do something.<br /><br />Summary is that the Olaplex softened and moisturized my hair and made it feel quite a bit thicker when I run my hands through it.  The thicker feeling hair is nice because my husband likes to run his hands through my hair and likes when it feels fuller, which has been difficult since going through menopause.  Olaplex is not a miracle to transform hair texture or type.  I have naturally fine and frizzy hair.  While it helped with the dryness, it did not transform my naturally frizzy hair. I will have to continue my search for the frizz cure.<br /><br />In before and after pics, the before are on the left.<br /><br />Overall, I like this product ok but it’s not amazing and I don't like the price.  It is very expensive and I used the entire bottle and continued and repeated use did not have a compounding effect.  I don't think I will purchase this again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FosmKG+xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FosmKG+xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FosmKG+xL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sQ5JF5i+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sQ5JF5i+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sQ5JF5i+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+MKXZBm7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+MKXZBm7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+MKXZBm7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FKb82BD+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FKb82BD+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FKb82BD+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AE23BYWB52METWQVHSPN3MKN7AJA,2020-02-16 20:29:14.368,141,True

The salon coloring made me hair even worse and I thought I was going to have to cut it short and start growing it out all over again.  I literally had to put conditioner on it just to keep it from frizzing out all over the place (it is naturally curly).<br />But then I tried this Olaplex and my hair is soft, shiny and beautiful again and the curls are bouncy and healthy looking.  I noticed a difference in after just one treatment, and now that I am on my second treatment, I'm buying another bottle for travel.

Well I didn't want to go back so I bought the shimmer lights shampoo and conditioner and it helped take that orange out! But my hair still looked nast dry and brittle! I decided to try olaplex treatment and so far its helping as you can see on the 3rd picture.  I will continue to use and will update!

5.0,"If there was an impostor problem before, it is gone now. It's the real deal","Some of the reviews said their product was fake and watered down. This was not the case for me. I recently lifted my natural almost-black hair to platinum blonde/silver. It took 3 salon visits to lift me this much, so parts of my hair were damaged and stretchy.  I received this yesterday and immediately got my hair wet, and put this all over my head, concentrating on the fuzzier parts. I put on a disposable shower cap, and wrapped my hair in a towel. I left it on for about four hours. I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and used 1/4-1/5 of the bottle. It was not watered down, and it smelled very nice-not like chemicals. After 4 hours, I washed and conditioned my hair as normal. When I got out of the shower, I combed my hair and could already see a huge difference! No more stretchy-ness in the damaged areas. Now that it is dry, it is much less fuzzy in the more processed areas. My hair doesn't feel softer (which is fine, my hair doesn't really soften anyways), but it LOOKS way healthier. I am amazed by this product. I would recommend it to anyone. I think by the time I am done with the bottle, my hair will be back to normal.

5.0,Worth every penny!,"*I purchased this product at full price and with my own money. As always, this will be a thorough and honest review of my experiences with this product. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! I would be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability. If you find any of this review helpful, I would very much appreciate it if you could click that 'helpful' button right below to let me know. :) Thank you!<br /><br />[I used manic panic (so no bleach or developers) as well between the first picture and the second, which is why the color looks a bit different. The manic panic and the Olaplex treatment are the only things that I had done to my hair between the two pictures, and my hair is air dried without product in both photos.]<br /><br />Quick background on my hair situation and where I was at when I used the Olaplex No.3 (basically why): I have color treated my own hair for about a decade. Through trial and error, I have figured out what works best for my hair, and my hair stylists have always told me that they can't believe how healthy my hair is, especially because it's fully color treated at-home. I recently decided that I wanted to add some texture into my fairly straight hair, so I permed it (myself). This isn't a disaster story, it turned out great! It's just that perms are incredibly harsh and damaging on virgin hair, let alone color treated hair. While I absolutely *loved* my hair when it was wet, by the time that it dried, it just looked a little bit fried. I tried a handful of  moisturizing masks and overnight oils and protein treatments and they helped, but only a little bit. (The first picture is after those other treatments, but before the Olaplex treatment.)<br /><br />What I did:<br />- made my hair slightly damp<br />- carefully went through section by section and coated the hair in the Olaplex (make sure the hair is saturated, but don't just glop extra product on, that is a waste of expensive product)<br />- once my entire head was coated in the Olaplex, I wrapped it in cling wrap, then wrapped a warm towel around my head to help give the Olaplex the best environment in which to to work it's magic<br />- I left it on for a couple of hours (two or three, I don't remember exactly - I just watched some TV)<br />- rinsed it out in lukewarm water and let it air dry<br /><br />I saw immediate results. This stuff is amazing! My hair looked healthy again right away. It dried and looked the way that it did when it was wet, plus it was shiny and had natural movement back to it again. I had a haircut the following day and the stylist couldn't believe that I had permed color treated hair at home a week ago and this is what my hair looked and felt like that day. She said that if she hadn't seen me before, she never would have guessed it based on the health of my hair.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, I would say do it. I wish that I had not wasted all of that money on other treatments (probably about what a bottle of this stuff costs) and had just gone to this stuff right off the bat. It works miracles where the others simply didn't.<br /><br />Another really cool positive is that because I was so intentional with how much product I was using (only enough to coat the hair and not extra), I only used a third of the bottle! (And my hair isn't exactly short, and it's fairly thick.) This stuff is expensive and the bottle is small, but if you use it well, it will go a lot farther than it looks. *Definitely* worth it!<br /><br />The only downside that I had was that it took nearly an entire work week to get here (when I had Prime two-day shipping) which can feel like forever when it is something to do with your hair and you still have to go out and live your life. While this isn't the sellers fault, it is what happened so I thought that I would share. Even with that delay, it was well worth the wait!<br /><br />Let me know if this was helpful. I rely heavily on reviews when making my own decisions so I want to be as helpful to those who come after me as I possibly can be. :)<br />Have a great day!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g0C2P8beL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g0C2P8beL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g0C2P8beL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zJEnuqAvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zJEnuqAvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zJEnuqAvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFO3U2LYUAUKZZMVTHC6RZUEWKPQ,2018-02-18 19:59:25.662,2,False

And I realized my hair is currently in terrible shape - fried ends where the bleached highlights burned me, thinned from stress shedding (thankfully that’s resolved with a change of situation) and over washing.  I started researching what might help regrowth and the frizz.  I came across his method for repairing damage with this product, and his method for daily hair care.  I cannot believe the difference that a single 10 minute treatment made.  My wave pattern and volume are almost what they were in the photo last year, even with the chop job layers and shaping my hair dresser did to me. The texture feels more luxurious and less matted.  There are a lot of broken ends and I can do nothing but keep them trimmed and wait for the damages to grow out to its former glory, but this magical elixir for my hair is going to keep me sane and ensure it looks the best it can while I wait.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AHSE7YIUS2HC63Q2NAO6E7XY522Q,2023-04-10 01:37:59.774,10,True

1.0,Disappointing.,"I was so excited to receive this, but I was very disappointed in the results. I have extremely thick, porous, coarse chest-length hair, and I used 2/3 of the bottle for one application. I was hoping this would help mend my straw like ends, in preparation for another treatment of bleach. I used according to the directions, and there was absolutely no change after blowdrying/styling my hair as usual. I wasn't expecting a miracle, but I was hoping my hair would at least seem a little softer or stronger after using this treatment. I asked for a refund, which Amazon granted. When I was randomly out and about today at Rite Aid, I ended up picking up Hask coconut treatment packets. I don't usually go for treatment packets, as they usually don't provide any results for my hair type, but I was really impressed with the results. My hair feels softer and my ends are not nearly as straw-like. It was more effective than regular coconut oil as well.

5.0,It (probably) works!,"Just bleached my hair pale ash blonde from a virgin level 2 black. Only shampoo once or twice a month, no or VERY rare heat, hair masks in lieu of washing about once a week. So my hair started out pretty healthy and stayed pretty healthy through the bleaching and toning but it got a bit dry on the ends.<br /><br />I used it after bleaching and before toning. I’ve only used it once but have also been doing hair oil treatments and some other hair masks I’ve never used before through the whole ordeal so it’s hard to pinpoint what helped most. I’ll update after a few weeks of use but whatever the cause, my hair is 99% back to its former glory (1% taken off because it’s got way more volume now which I’m assuming is due to some inevitable damage that I cannot feel with my fingers) even after 3 bleaching processes with 30 volume and one toning session with 20 volume. If you’ve already got unhealthy hair and you don’t take care of it, I doubt it’ll help you but it will probably help maintain healthy hair through something like bleaching.<br />Note: I gave it 5 stars because it’s worth investing in but ideally I’d knock off a star because the bottle is so small (expected this. added carmex to a picture for scale) and you have to use so much even for a guy like me with shortish hair. Just not cost effective enough for me to buy it more than once seeing as I take good care of my hair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DyxfyvieL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DyxfyvieL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DyxfyvieL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mG2x+SEaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mG2x+SEaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mG2x+SEaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shLCuZjNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shLCuZjNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shLCuZjNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AFXCKLBSBCK7OCCHIJPUSTLI6IPA,2019-02-01 18:59:36.307,83,True

I had extremely HEALTHY, LONG, THICK blonde hair! It fell to the middle of my back, It was absolutely beautiful. I went to get it colored to give it a break from the highlights, I was going to change it to a strawberry blonde, which I have been many times before and other than blonde, its the only other color I like on me. When I went to the salon, they messed up the color. I ended up with hot pinkish, purple roots and a grayish auburn, mid-shaft to ends. I was in the salon that day for 7 and a half hours. They had to bleach my entire head and leave it on to get all of the screwed up colors out of my hair, resulting to EXTREME chemical damage and breakage. I went in with my hair being all one length to having bangs that were never even cut into my hair. My hair was destroyed and they had to take over 5inches off just to get the ends to LOOK healthy. My hair now sits on my shoulders and has broken pieces all over the top and mid section and all around my hair line. I have literally cried about this since it happened 5 weeks ago. It took me forever to get my hair exactly the way I wanted it and now I am starting over. My hair is no longer manageable, it is kinky and dry and looks it! The salon I had gone to was a new salon closer to where I moved. Prior to this salon I had been going to my original hairstylist for 15 years (I'm 30) so half of my life one person has touched my hair. I live two hours from her now so I decided to give a different salon a try and it was a mistake. I will now be driving 2 hours to go to her every 8 weeks. I texted her about 2 weeks after this all happened and she told me right away to order this product. I didn't hesitate. I ordered it and received it the beginning of this week. I have used it twice so far and I will tell you what, after the first time I noticed a difference! I am excited to see after a couple months and using this 3 times a week (Extremely damaged hair should use it more than once a week). I also have been sleeping with it on over night which I notice gives me better results. This is not a conditioning treatment, so it does need to be shampooed out.

There was nothing I could do as far as covering it up.<br />Desperate I bought the Olaplex with high hopes of minor improvement even. I knew that in reality it could only do some much. Well the thing is, nothing changed. I even had it on all night, just under 8 hours.<br />Very disappointed and wish this had worked even a little bit, especially for the price.<br />To those who are trying to heal their hair I would recommend investing in a large container of coconut oil.

5.0,"Holy Crap, Batman!!!","This stuff is AMAZING!! I'm a natural haired (no relaxer) black girl, with very curly (3a type) hair. I have very dark brown hair, so I color my hair regularly (full head of highlights). The Olaplex system is a game changer. This is not like all the other products I've purchased that sit on top of the hair, or makes your hair feel great until you wash it out... It actually repairs your hair, strand by strand! And the difference is REMARKABLE. I've used everything imaginable to improve the elasticity and strength of my hair. I co-wash, I use a variety of oils to seal my hair, do protective styling, steam conditioning, etc. etc...  but my hair always broke off a bit when I colored it. (Not to mention that curly hair is just prone to breakage anyway!) I have used the complete Olaplex system (numbers 1 and 2 in the salon) and bought #3 to use at home... And I couldn't be more thrilled!! So-- If you are going to get your hair colored at a salon, ask for Olaplex. Yeah, it costs extra. And yeah, it's worth it. Buy and use the take home product (#3) every few weeks, if you had preexisting, damaged hair. (Be sure to use #3 as directed-- it is NOT a conditioner. If you use it like a conditioner, your hair will be stronger and shiny, but DRY!)  So remember to condition well after! If you have virgin hair that is damaged you can use the system to repair your hair without adding any color (many salons will provide that service if you ask.) It seriously best the hair product of the year!! My curl pattern is more defined, I have less frizz (even without product) and my hair feels like it's brand new.  Strong! Shiny! Soft!

5.0,WOW!!!!!,"Let me start by saying this thing is a miracle worker! I've been hearing about this for years but never had a damaging chemical process that I'd need to use it, until now. I decided to dye my hair blue, it's something I have been wanting to do for years but didn't want to bleach my full head, I have reddish brown hair, a medium to dark brown, that I dye with permanent hair color, so I bleached my entire head with 40 volume peroxide and bleach powder, luckily my hair bleached easily to a very pale blonde that I didn't need to bleach again, but that first round destroyed my curly hair. I have loose curls/waves and my hair looked like brillo when it was dry. I was so nervous, I couldn't comb through, it was elastic, it was a mess. I then dyed it using Arctic fox hair dye which is vegan, no chemicals and moisturizes the hair. My hair then looked great color wise, it was soft but looked fried, and I mean fried!!! That was Last Monday, so I spent the week doing loads of Argan oil, had to flat iron it to help hide the extreme damage, but still the ends would look super dry and pretty much like brillo, and we had the worst week in NYC, hot and very humid, which didn't help at all. So I decided to buy this, was skeptical about the &#34;Fake&#34; reviews, so I bought directly from amazon and not third party sellers, just to be extra sure. I received the product sealed, looking fine. The consistency is thick, its very concentrated. I washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo to remove all the Argan oil i used and then put Olaplex all over my hair, combed, put a shower cap and let it stay for 2 hours. Then rinsed, shampooed and put a &#34;It's a 10&#34; hair mask for about 10 minutes and massaged it on my hair. And wow, just wow, my hair felt like hair again, I was able to blow dry it straight with a comb, and NO and I mean Not a single hair got stuck or broke off on the brush! My hair is back to life! It's soft, shiny, super strong and  I&#34;m so happy again!!! This pic is from a couple of hours after I used it and you can see it looks like hair and not a steel sponge!

My hair is naturally a dark blonde but I have done everything imaginable to my hair from trying to use chemical straighteners, then going back to strip even more blonde and become a platinum blonde, then add color again....I did it all. This last year my hair has really let me know how well I have treated it along the years. It went from being about mid back to just to my shoulders by damage and breaking off and when I would blow it dry it literally became a fuzz ball mess.<br />My hair dresser introduced me to this amazing product when she saw what my hair was turning into.<br />Literally within 2 months of using this my hair is entirely different and much more manageable. I don't use it as directed on the bottle though.<br />I was my hair with biolage shampoo and perfect 10 conditioner. I then put about a nickle sized amount into my hands and I finger comb in through then I brush it and wait about 10min. Afterwards I blow dry it very lightly, not on high heat but not on cool.

My hair has been bleached time and time again, I finally decided to go back to my natural brown with a blonde balayage, Needless to say, even going to a professional who was VERY mindful with my hair, always doing things slowly as not to damage it, I still ended up frying my hair. I have thin hair and an oily scalp so I stay away from heavy conditioners or products that add to the oily look. Being purple for a year, almost black before that, and heavily highlighted before that, my hair had been through a lot of stress. A few weeks ago I was so sick and tired of the breakage (visible when brushing), like BAD breakage, I finally decided to try out the Olaplex I had heard so much about. I didn't tell my stylist I was doing it, but I would be seeing her a few days after my treatment for a touch up. As soon as she started working with my hair she asked my what I did that it looked so so healthy. We ended up not having to cut much off because it was so great. I was preparing to cut off three plus inches and this stuff saved me. I listened to a friend of mine who is a prof stylist and works with vivids who reccomended I sleep with it on. i got about 10 hours with it on over night, washed and styled my hair like normal the next morning and I havent had to straighten it to ""tame"" it since. i have been styling it just blow drying it with a round brush.

5.0,MOST AMAZING PRODUCT EVER,"So I don't normally write reviews, but this product is so unbelievable I felt compelled to. I've had my hair bleached countless time over the past 4 years, and prior to that I colored my hair frequently with box dyes. I usually have a new hair color every few months so needless to say my hair was pretty brittle. Well I got my hair done (balayage) again about a month ago, and touched up the color with toner at home this week. Well after the touch up my hair was fried (I even used the lowest volume developer 10!). So I found this beauty of a product and decided to give it a try and I don't regret anything. This stuff Is AMAZING! Before using it I couldn't run my fingers through my hair because it was so dry & I was afraid of brushing it because I could just see it all breaking off and I'd pull heaps out of my brush.

I had some breakage when bleaching as well and since using the olaplex i havent had additional breakage or hair loss. The only down side is the price and the amount of product you get.

My hair went from frizzy straw-like texture to feeling actually SILKY! I've done a third treatment, and it's getting even better. Definitely worth the $30.

5.0,"that's great, but","Ok, so I am not a fan of writing reviews because, if something works, hey, that's great, but, the reality is that when it comes to hair it is important to know what you have that will save your hair from getting damage and still get the healthy hair you want. Ok, background story, I first got highlights when I was 24 years old, so the hair was virgin, I have a very dark brown hair. I loved it, but it was just temporary, then, I decided to make my hair blond. It looked great, as my hair was virgin, it took like 2 processes (I have a great hairstylist). Then, I went back to dark brown back in 2007. I cut my hair a lot, many times from 2007 - 2009 and then I wanted to be blond again! So, by that time, my hair was virgin again because I had cut it so many times really short, meaning, I had gotten rid of the colored hair...Ok, now, don't get bored, I went back to not only dark brown, but black in 2012. That was it. I said: Oh too much maintenance, I'm over it! Not true, now, last month, I decided to go back to blond. Now, it is harder because I just colored my hair pitch black earlier in the year. Ok, so, what to do? I heard about Olaplex, as I don't want to lose hair or get it damaged. My black hair was very healthy, and so, I told my stylist and she told me to get it. I did. Now comes the good part: OH MY GOD THAT IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!!! Just make sure you get it with reputable places, as with many things in life, you can get a fake. But I am telling you, if I tell you it's because I am impressed. My hair looks super healthy, I did two processes. I bought the 1, 2 3. My hair did lift colors faster, and I have been using the Number 3 before I watch my hair (be careful, this product is strong, so although they recommend to leave it in as well if you want to, I rather not), and my hair is just so very healthy. My hairstylist did a nice job, she kept my roots darker than the rest of my hair and we left certain parts of the hair darker, meaning, she didn't color all the same. I have an olive completion, so it looks like my hair, because the shine the product gives adds luster to the hair. I sincerely recommend this product. Go blond. Remember of course that this is not a miracle product, so if your hair is damage already be careful on putting on lighting your hair too quick! If you are like that I recommend you don't process your hair, but do buy this product anyways, as it will really repair your hair. I know it is only meant to be used for coloring light, but forget it, I will use it even I do decide to go back to black! It is really a good product.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AEVQQU2SWYNPEDHWQAHIWGMLPS2A,2016-09-22 20:58:16.000,0,True

5.0,Definitely worth it,"So like many of you, I was stupid enough to bleach my hair at home.  Multiple times.

It’s been like 5 months since I stopped bleaching my hair and it’s come a long way, but I still get comments about how to deal with the damage to my hair.  So I ordered this which came highly recommended.  I also bought the conditioner.  I left the product on over night and then woke up and washed and conditioned my hair.  I definitely notice a huge difference both in the texture and appearance of mg hair:  this is only after one trearment.  I’m doing round 2 tonight and will probably do 2-3 treatments a week for a while.  This definitely seems like it will help reduce the length I will need to remove.

If you have this done by a stylist you are guaranteed the products correct, not out dated and not tampered with. For those saying that it is one star, you get what you pay for.

4.0,Too soon to tell,"Bought this yesterday at a store. Did some hair colour and highlights with olaplex 1 and 2 yesterday. Not really sure on results, my hair got pretty dry and some broke off, perhaps the ones that broke off were already dead.  The hairdresser said its not a miracle product but helps prevent the amount of damage caused. Not like guy tang pubes to paradise video. My hair was in ok shape prior to that appointment. I had done a pretty awesome protein treatment and wow my hair was better than ever. I'll keep adding the #3 once a week until bottle is over. Probably do another review. What I liked is my hair is up to my bum and so thick and I have a lot of hair and I thought I'd have to empty this tiny container but no, a lot more is left, it spreads out like serum mixed with a light body milk if that makes sense. I guess I just need moister and protein back in my hair and I know olaplex is not for that.

I have gotten better results from using pantene sulfate free conditioner as a hair mask and that stuff is 10$ for 32oz so I kind of think this product is a huge scam.

5.0,Great buy,"Saved my hair. Saved what had little damage, helped with what was damaged beyond repair. & I say that because I have big curly hair, since getting an ombre and over using bleach at the salon the ends of my hair was wavy to straight texture, while from my chin up was lovely ringlet curls.. I ended up having to cut my hair from armpit length, to shoulder length to get rid of that odd mixture. Olapex did make my hair smoother, more manageable, and feel so healthy but couldn't save my curls as good as it could. my hair is 3a, the best it could do to my bottom half portion was 2a, rather than straight.

5.0,Amazing product.,"I have light blonde hair that I have been colouring for about 30 years with bleach, highlights and the odd bottle of Sun In in the 80's and 90's. The main damage happened about 2 years ago when I was living in China, they misunderstood my translated message and thought I wanted Golden Blonde, which happened to turn bright yellow, I looked like a canary. I actually nearly started crying in the chair. I then had to sit through bleach twice all over my hair to get it looking decent. 7 hours later I had a beautiful creamy blonde colour but my hair was ravaged, and it felt like fairy floss. Recently I was in a salon in KL and the hairdresser commented on the damage in the lengths of my hair and suggested I try Olaplex. I thought why not, can't hurt to try. I received my bottle yesterday and had to try it straight away, since then I've been raving about it to all my friends. One treatment and my hair is now smoother, softer, and stronger. It also looks like it has toned down the blonde as well. I never thought anything would work so well. I only wish I knew about this product earlier. I never rave about a hair care product because usually they always end up being good on paper but a huge disappointment after using, this is totally different.

5.0,Amazing protein bond fixer,"Like the product says, it’s not a deep conditioner. It’s not going to leave your hair silky smooth and soft. It’s meant to reform the shattered and broken protein bonds in your hair. I bleached my dark, asian hair twice into a platinum blonde. Understandably so my hair was severely damaged and breaking off my head if I even brushed it too hard. So I bought olaplex and I’ve only used it for a one hour long session so far. I’m not kidding when I say after I finished washing my hair, my hair felt stronger than before. Maybe not to its original state but at least my hair wasn’t falling out. It did make my hair feel a lot less crunchy but I can’t tell if it’s the olaplex or the conditioner I love to use. Im hopeful that with another or two sessions of olaplex, my hair would be close to its original strength. For now Im very happy with the results. My hair isnt falling off my head even when Im a little more rough when combing. I dont see a lot of split ends, and Im hopeful of how my hair will turn out with more sessions.",[],B00SNM5US4,B00SNM5US4,AGEZXR2YLREADPNNMAGXELH27E3Q,2019-02-10 23:37:55.598,0,True

5.0,It’s not a F A K E!!,"Soo upon reading the reviews on this olaplex, I was a little torn whether not if it was real or a fake, tbh.  But I took the risk n ordered it, and since I received it the other day I finally<br />Decided to do a treatment today on my hair. I can genuinely tell u that this is the real thing. I had a little left over from a previous olaplex that I ordered from Sephora and I tested the bottle, smell and of course texture of the product. But most importantly, if it worked on my hair just as my other bottle. And it did!! I got the same or better results. So if you were feeling like I was on whether or not it’s real, don’t worry it is!
