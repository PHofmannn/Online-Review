4.0,Awesome Gaming Mouse,"I've been using this mouse for a couple of years now, and am mostly happy with it. It's comfortable and very responsive. I especially like the scroll wheel. One minor frustration is the extra buttons near where you place your thumb. All too often I end up accidentally bumping one of those buttons.

5.0,Excellent gaming / everyday mouse,"I bought this mouse without reading many of the reviews. I searched for ""silent mouse"" and followed a trail of products until I landed on this Logitech G502 HERO mouse. I don't know if it was advertised as quiet or silent, but it doesn't matter too much at this point. The mouse is very well crafted, and the weights that are provided allow you to customize how heavy the mouse is. I didn't think this would make a big difference, but it truly does. The weight keeps the mouse parallel to the desk surface but doesn't seem to inhibit movement at all. It's a fantastic feeling. Additionally, the mouse is wired, which eliminates having to worry about batteries or latency with a wireless connection.<br />I use this mouse for gaming and for everyday office use, but gamers who are more ""serious"" about their gaming will find all the bells and whistles needed. There are around 10 buttons on this mouse, and the software that is downloaded from the Logitech website makes setting up the functions very easy.<br />I believe this mouse was under $40 or $50 dollars when I bought it, and it is worth every penny in my opinion.<br />(By the way, it is not a quiet or silent mouse, but the clicks don't make much more noise than you'd expect of a high quality mouse.)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF477YST23LH5KFYR32ZBIVSBLEA,1675186114873,2,True
1.0,"2 for 2, failed buttons. Just get a Deathadder","I wanted to like this mouse. I like the position of the buttons (particularly the toggle DPI that lets you have a ""snipe"" button - more mice need that) and the general shape of the mouse, but it's just got so many problems, including abysmal build quality (which is shocking for logitech)<br /><br />For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it. I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse. Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC.<br /><br />The feet lasted okay, they're starting to feel worn after a year of use on an aluminum banshee pad mousepad (I usually got about 2-3 years out of a set of feet on a Razer Deathadder) And they're very sensitive to picking up schmutz. Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape. The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months. Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a ""clean"" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement. Not even sure it would when it was new. The  aforementioned teknet mouse still absolutely glides after years. I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower.<br /><br />Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie.<br /><br />The scroll wheel is abysmal. It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced. I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed. The ability to unlock a scroll wheel is nice when I have to turbo scroll through a 300 page document, but again, in GAMING practice, is just one more way the scroll wheel feels incredibly vague and inaccurate.<br /><br />mouse 4 is just set too far back. You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward ""palm pinch"". If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much.<br /><br />And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile. My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off. The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it. After only a year, this is appalling. If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare. If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony.<br /><br />And there's something about this mouse that gives me really sweaty palms, which is weird because I have a kind of hybrid palm/fingertip grip that keeps my palm usually hovering just above the mouse<br /><br />My deathadder was only replaced by this mouse because I suspected the skin flakes embedded in the chassis had evolved a new form of life. This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half. I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFG2T5XGMQCACK7JBDRHKEKWJLPA,1623952759656,2,True

4.0,"Excellent hardware with broken software support, use Logitech's legacy software","Excellent mouse, as advertised with no hardware issues.<br /><br />However, Logitech's G Hub software is a dumpster fire of an application. Logitech pushes updates that break the app itself or hardware functionality (like not registering left clicks). Background cpu usage is upwards of 15% on a Ryzen 3600 system. G Hub feels like an alpha release and Logitech hasn't be able to improve stability or app performance since they released G Hub back in February 2019. Yes, thats 7 months of garbage software support for their flagship hardware products. Save yourself the pain and DO NOT DOWNLOAD G HUB.<br /><br />The fix is to use the legacy 'Logitech Gaming Software' which is still available and does include support for the 502 Hero. I'm using the LGS 9.02.65 release hosted on TechSpot and have no issues. LGS supports button rebinding as well as LED color control in a reliable fashion, unlike G Hub.<br /><br />This would be an easy 5 star review but in 2019 I should not be forced to use legacy software to ensure my hardware functions properly.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGZ7ISNOBAY2RIYCZ3BFWNJ2LVXQ,1570932175053,0,True

The rubber on the side grips feels good.<br />Settings can be saved to onboard memory, so the color and speed and button tweaks work on any machine, not just ones with the driver and your profile installed, unlike Razor.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Feels light/cheap even with the added weights, like every piece of plastic was as thin as they could make it without it shattering during shipping.<br /><br />The scroll wheel wobbles just slightly left and right (it is supposed to move left right when pushed, but I mean just by moving the mouse on the desk, the wheel flops a 1/2 millimeter back and forth, causing a distracting rattle. It does it less when you turn off freewheel and use clicky wheel, but it's still audible there, too.<br /><br />Some settings don't seem to be editable in onboard memory, you have to download the profile, update it there, then re-upload it. Wouldn't be a big deal, but you can't even view the button customizations without downloading, it just tells you how many buttons were programmed, not what they do.<br /><br />Not built for large hands - feels 80% of normal size.

5.0,Epic,"I just bought a Logitech Mechanical Keyboard a few weeks ago along with one of the new Ergo trackballs. I love both, and they are just amazing. However the trackball is tremendous for work, not so tremendous for gaming. I've not used a high end gaming mouse and was really excited about this.<br /><br />First, it looks great.  It matches the mechanical keyboards they make, or even most of the competitors.  It really has the looks department down.  At first I found it a little too light to the point it almost felt flimsy but then I used the weights that come with it and you get several of them so you can find the perfect balance you want.  It's excellent.<br /><br />Feature wise, it lets you do so much but  I think if you're used to gaming mice, it's probably not as big of a deal for you as it was for me.  The fact  you can change the buttons and build small routines is very cool but I know that's been available for a while.<br /><br />What stands out though is both the responsiveness (which is tremendous) and the level of control and precision) .  The scroll feature allows you to refine scrolling in conjunction with the other movement and it all 'just works'.<br /><br />Yes, it's worth every penny and then some.

5.0,There is no better mouse,"This is my second g502. I want to say how amazing that is. I almost never buy the same product twice. Checking my history, I got the last one 5 years ago, and it survived daily use, and heavy gaming. Eventually the left click began to stick and randomly release while holding. 5 years though to me is a good amount of time and use to get out of anything you use daily.<br /><br />The scroll wheel and the weight of this mouse are what I love most. The scroll wheel can be unlocked and sound freely, making reading long documents and scrolling through things a breeze. The weight suits my use of a mouse.<br /><br />There are two schools of thought when it comes to gaming mice. Some prefer an ultralight mouse suited to moving a lot. This is what the younger generation seems to be gravitating towards. I don't like to move my arm or wrist too much during prolonged use because this leads to carpal tunnel and wrist strain. The G502 is NOT an ultralight.<br /><br />The second school is made up of heavy mice, intentionally weighted down. These mice have a much higher DPI than the first kind of mouse, leading to a much more sensitive mouse. Users preferring this style use micro movements with their fingertips to navigate a PC. It takes a while to get used to DPI above 20k, but once you do you'll wonder how you lived without.<br /><br />Anyways, it's rare to see a product that is as consistently awesome as this one is, and I hope they never stop making them.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG6W3AMM4IGTHABIIQGARNMBH3QQ,1648637739759,0,True

2.0,Awesome mouse for the short window it lasts,"I loved the ergonomics and button position and weight of this mouse. Very smooth and the weight added heft which I enjoy.<br /><br />Now I have purchased 3 of the G502 heros and they went like this: the first one died on me after a year of so but I was hard on it so I ordered a replacement. After about 1 year the replacement one suddenly had what I could only describe as a flutter in the right click button. If I held down the right button it wouldn't stay held it would turn off and on. A good description is when playing an FPS I would ADS and in the screen it would flicker the gun up and down over and over and not actually keep aiming down the sights in game it was as if I was manually rapid clicking the button; but I wasn't, I was holding it solid. The third one I bought because I figured that other one was a fluke freak... So the third one after about 6 months it did the exact same identical thing except on the left click button. Which makes dragging and dropping files on the pc impossible and makes highlights in word docs or excel docs impossible! So now I know it is a G502 hero issue I have had 3 and all lasted about a year to a year and a half and all just stopped functioning. The first just sometimes didn't seem to recognize clicks, the second the right click flickered, and the third the left click flickered.<br /><br />I love the feel and weight so much!

The dpi is very high so just a small movement of the mouse would all the pointer to go clear across the screen.  The bad is the mouse wheel.  There is no friction on the wheel so when you scroll or roll the wheel it just keeps going.  Than means you have to keep your finger on the wheel to stop it.  Also, every time I use the wheel and let it go, the page jumps around.  Sometimes up or down.

5.0,An absolute joy to use,"When I first had seen this mouse - and the special edition version which is uglier and $15 cheaper right now - I thought it looked extra and ridiculous between the multicolor LED and the weird design and the thumb-rest wing type thing on the side. I literally ONLY bought this because the multi-tilt scroll-wheel on my G500S was broken and the mouse was 3 years old so I believe out of warranty. That said, it's been smooth as butter from the beginning. It does require a newer version of the LGS than older peripherals did, but installing it didn't mess up my G933 or G810 profiles at all - something you should expect but these days you can't. The mouse has good weight without the custom weights - which like all Logitech gaming mice come in their own separate case and can be mixed and matched. Unlike the MX517, G500, and other previous lines, there is no weight tray - it's built in to the bottom of the mouse. Just life the panel on the bottom. I personally am not using them. This unit definitely has the precision, out of the box, for Photoshop work as well. Gaming I honestly haven't noticed a huge improvement but it has stayed the same, and that's all I needed. The scroll wheel has the same two modes as the G500 - theres a loud clicky mode with more traction, and a quiet smoother mode for faster scrolling. As with other Logitech gaming products, you can turn the LED off completely, or sync it with the LEDs from your other devices. I love it and it was on sale for maybe $50 or so, to be honest I don't remember the price because it was low.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dxMSTAGzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dxMSTAGzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dxMSTAGzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7spCAuvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7spCAuvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7spCAuvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iNXX7b-WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iNXX7b-WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iNXX7b-WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710sM9J2O7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710sM9J2O7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710sM9J2O7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7186gpGG7OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7186gpGG7OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7186gpGG7OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzoCx6wSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzoCx6wSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzoCx6wSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eBvSwcBFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eBvSwcBFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eBvSwcBFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFJ7ZWXZW3QB3BYAT3I7UK7YU5PA,1574900165603,0,True

I bought this as a lightning deal for $39. So, 40 bucks is a fair price point for this mouse - a separate software download from the internet makes it completely customizable to your liking. This is both a pro and con b/c 1) I hate bloatware from an internet download and 2) I can spend hours setting it up when I'd rather be gaming. The weights that come with it are nice quality.<br /><br />The regular price is somewhere around $60-$70... I'd say forget that! Pros include weights you can add/subtract, DPI options, and LED lights with option to sync with other Logitech products. Cons: Too big for my hand, lack of control b/c of overall size.<br /><br />PS I learned after my purchase there is a mid-size version of this mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGR5XSUVCTBIZKDPWAWZHDKDRP4Q,1616606798353,0,True

I wish this had one more thumb button, as I tend to bind this to the “inventory” of the games I play.<br />The cable is super flexible, so it doesn’t “spring” the mouse when you let go of it, like my old mouse occasionally did.<br />The mouse works with G Hub for programming macros and such, which is miles ahead of the Logitech gaming software in terms of creating macros and other keybinds.<br />The mouse has a decent weight to it without using the supplied weights, but that’s personal preference.

Long story short, I thought for 40 bucks I was getting a cheaper quality mouse compared to my other one. Instead I received a great quality mouse that felt better in my hand and even shocked me with its great remapping software. The integrated games mapping is awesome. Before I had to go into a game and find the mapping to make a profile on my mouse and remap that to whatever button I wanted. With the Logitech software it scans the games and tells you exactly what mappings do what. It's kind of hard to explain but it makes things so much easier! If you try this out you'll see what I mean.

The mouse wheel was either to tight or if I used the free wheel it was to loose.

5.0,Solid Gaming Mouse,"I’ve read a lot of reviews where people complain about a double clicking issue or uncomfortable button locations and stuff so I thought I’d share my thoughts.<br /><br />I got it a week ago and so far I’ve experienced zero issues with it whatsoever but the double clicking problem usually doesn’t develop until later so if it does come up eventually, I will update my review.<br /><br />The sensor is this mouse is legit, one of the best I’ve ever come across and I’ve used a lot of gaming mice in my life. From Razer to Alienware, this one competes with the best of them. The adjustable weights are also a plus. I’m not hardcore on FPS so I don’t use them but they can come in handy for those of you who are into shooters. The extra buttons are also a big plus. It has a couple and they can be very useful.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is the mouse itself is rather a bit small for my taste and I think it could use a pinky support but I do have large hands so perhaps it isn’t applicable for everyone. Also while it does have many extra buttons, the thumb one is awkwardly positioned right under the thumb so I frequently press it by mistake. The two index finger buttons next to left click are also a bit inconvenient because one would have to move the index finger off the important left click to use them.<br /><br />Conclusion: I got it on sale for $39.99 and for the price it’s a fantastic deal. At its full price of $80 however they may be better options but either way, it is a solid product.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFRHKYHG4SPRO44RN6XUUX5HVOGQ,1604363641989,0,True

2.0,LOGITECH has FALLEN OFF. DO NOT BUY THIS.,"DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS MOUSE.<br /><br />Logitech is known for making high quality products, so the assumption is that this mouse will be worth buying. If you're looking at this mouse, then you already know the specs. However, you need to go online and on Youtube and search for ""LOGITECH G2 HERO DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE"". Once you do, you will find that this mouse has a serious design and quality flaw. The mouse's left button will begin to double click, by itself, uncontrollably and intermittently. And it gets worse over time, to the point that you can do no work, or play, with the mouse. It becomes unreliable to select, copy, or do any precision clicking.<br /><br />NO TECH SUPPORT FROM LOGITECH<br />So... Logitech took down its phone line and only interacts via email. They say that its due to covid 19 - but we're in October... other companies have figured out how to adjust. Apparently, Logitech has not. If they were attentive, that would be okay. They are not. When you contact them for this mouse - and you will , once the double clicking starts - they will ask you for A CRAP TON of information, and make you record video of you troubleshooting your own mouse, and emailing them links to your video. THEN, they will take over a week to respond.. with another REQUEST for more trouble shooting videos.<br /><br />They will go back and forth with you for a month - and only 1 email a week, and then stop responding.<br /><br />I had to file a complaint with my state consumer protection division, and post the complaint on their Facebook page, before SUDDENLY they sent me a replacement mouse. So all was fixed right?<br /><br />WRONG. The second mouse has the same double clicking issue, which manifested within 2 weeks of use. The previous mouse lasted 5 months before the double clicking got so bad that I first contacted Logitech.<br /><br />VERDICT<br />Do not buy this mouse. Watch the videos. Search out the complaints about Logitech's tech support. My experience was not unique, nor is the double clicking problem. I am giving Logitech products a wide berth now, no matter what bells and whistles they have, because of the HORRENDOUS tech support. I solved my own problem by buying a replacement Redragon brand mouse - a cheaper brand that will AT LEAST last longer than 2 weeks or 5 months.  It's so sad to see a good company go down the tubes.<br /><br />I uploaded pictures of my double click error test with my NEW REPLACEMENT mouse. 18 errors in 204 clicks, and that was my BEST result. This mouse is TRASH, and all the good reviews are likely from new purchases, when the mouse is still working and fine. Wait a few weeks or months.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8b1XIWJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8b1XIWJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J8b1XIWJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MJ5VLHPCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MJ5VLHPCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MJ5VLHPCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TKo4+LVsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TKo4+LVsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TKo4+LVsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF767SHQWVZ4NABETHXILLLETI5A,1603432015257,2,False

The left click button is on the thin side, which I never seem to have an issue with having thin fingers myself. But right beside the left click button are 2 buttons that will adjust the speed of your pointer on screen and these 2 buttons are entirely too easy to misclick with even the slightest shift of your finger.<br /><br />You can adjust the speed the pointer changes too with each click on the logitec app, but I cannot seem to get the fastest button to go below 3000 dpi, the app simply stops at that number and won't go below it, so I go from my standard slow mouse speed, that I love to one that shoots my pointer across the screen so fast I can't find it half the time.

2.0,First time Logitech products have let me down,"I'll preface this by saying I've pretty much been a one-brand guy for the last 10+ years when it comes to computer peripherals - pretty much every mouse, keyboard, and webcam I've purchased since starting to build computers has been a Logitech product. This mouse was great...while it lasted. About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click. In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down. This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible. After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse. Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work. I submitted a support request to Logitech and haven't heard back in a week. I certainly won't buy another G502 to replace this one, and I'll have to consider other brands based on this experience.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFWU7GGJK6P5TLS3X2B2VMPRVDEA,1589382328122,2,True

5.0,Great mouse,"This is competing with the g300s for my favorite mouse.<br /><br />Buttons: It has enough buttons to assign several functions to them in games without going overboard. I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons.<br /><br />Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added. There is a hinged magnetic ""door"" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim. My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth. This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out. Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking.<br /><br />Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift ""sniper"" button but I never use those. It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed. Usually for browsing.<br /><br />Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc. The usual.<br /><br />Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly. It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens. I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the ""axle"" the scroll wheel is attached to.

It comes with a pack of weights you insert into the bottom of the mouse under a lid to get the weight/feel you desire.

3.0,Quality is questionable.,"So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.<br /><br />Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.<br /><br />Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.<br /><br />Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.<br /><br />Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.<br /><br />I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.<br /><br />The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.<br /><br />Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible.

I don't even use this for gaming really so the durability is questionable.<br /><br />I love the G602 and, besides the wireless version of the G502, the G502 wired is the closest thing to the G602. The mouse clicks feel nice and sound quiet just like the G602. The build quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap. However, my biggest complaint about this mouse is that it does not have the same amount programmable buttons the G602 had. It's a step backwards from the G602 in this regard and it would be amazing if more buttons were positioned on the left side of the mouse like the G602.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF4ZPCGQQCZWE72ENKCLPB3MQCYA,1625374490325,0,True

It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact. The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store. The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights. I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad. I immediately had enough, packaged it back up the way it came and started the refund process.<br /><br />Corsair, if you're reading this, please please please just fix the left click issue and you still have the best gaming mouse on the market.

Throwing in a fourth item that is software Logitech GHub focused, not so much on the mouse but is impacted:  4) software updates requires a system reboot and locks all functionality until restarted.<br /><br />Like I said, this used to be a great product and well produced.

3.0,Not as great as I expected,"Logitech makes really good computer accessories. I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas who are all into playing computer games. They watch these professional gamers who are using items like this and as a result think they need it too for better gaming. They were all excited when they saw I got them this mouse but after a few days of using it I could tell they were not all that impressed. It lights up and looks cool, but it is ultra sensitive. Even if you adjust your sensitivity or add some of the weights the mouse comes with it is still really sensitive. Maybe my kids just aren't good gamers, but they prefer my cheap Logitech wireless mouse over this one. For the price, I would not buy it again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w2M+nsuuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w2M+nsuuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w2M+nsuuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yjVEfecqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yjVEfecqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yjVEfecqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91jQ7uK4SPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91jQ7uK4SPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91jQ7uK4SPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ky9ac06dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ky9ac06dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ky9ac06dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEVHKUG4MXISWGQAY6YJROC3O5YQ,1610559649447,0,True

4.0,"Great gaming mouse, let down by a less than stellar middle button","After 12 years, my MADCATZ mouse finally gave up the ghost, and I needed a replacement gaming mouse.  As my budget now is much more limited, and MADCATZ isn't what it used to be, I chose to go with this one based on reviews I had read online. It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good.<br />The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button.  It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center. I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high. I keep the utility abilities on the middle button.  The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want.  However the side buttons on the wheel don't have a definite on/off click to them, and there is a sort of light clickyness as you move it side to side, almost like a two stage switch with a single function, and the angle of your finger can cause it to very easily trigger it, especially if you have used it recently for one of the side functions, and it's in the first stage. I have found that to ensure the right button is hit, that I have to stretch my finger flat over the wheel to ensure that I get a true straight down motion. Given this, as well as the placement of the other buttons, I wouldn't recommend this mouse to anyone with small hands, especially as there is no adjustment capability. With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse.<br />As for the rest, it integrates perfectly into my Logitech software for my G13 as well as any other Logitech hardware I may pick up in the future, and they work well together. I have had no tracking issues, and as I use a rather large HD TV as a monitor, it was simple to adjust tracking for a comfortable fit to my large screen while still keeping fine control over game movement.

1.0,"Bad mouse, worse software. DO NOT BUY","Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard.<br /><br />The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work. The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck. So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times.<br /><br />For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable. In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub .exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM. If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is.<br /><br />Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick.<br />My G700 also needed Logitech software to customize, but it had WORKING ON-BOARD MEMORY, meaning if I wanted to set the DPI and save it to the mouse for use on another PC I could easily do so, with the new G Hub software this is impossible.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XjL0Vx6yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XjL0Vx6yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XjL0Vx6yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AE3ZZLZRVDYEUAXWNPNS63DACXUQ,1617499772005,0,True

They are:<br /><br />Gamepad/Controller:  F710 and F310<br />Camera:  C910<br />Headset:  G933<br />Keyboard:  G105<br />Mouse: G502 Hero<br /><br />The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151.  The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.<br /><br />I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:<br /><br />1) The mouse<br />2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it.  They are:<br /> 2A)  A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.<br /> 2B)  A computer with a URL:  logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO<br /> 2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)<br /> 2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.<br />3) A black 6 sided box.<br /><br />When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products.  From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).<br /><br />I decided to contact Logitech support.  First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model.  When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice.  Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list.  The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse.  It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO.  This never ends.  It won't let me talk to an agent until I.  Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant.  (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it.  I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)<br /><br />In the end, I decide to call Logitech.  The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person.  She want to help me. Outstanding!  She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc.  Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:<br /><br />1) The G502-HERO manual.  I've yet to read it.<br />2) The G-Hub manual.<br />3) The G502-HERO downloads.<br />4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.<br /><br />I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset.  It doesn't recognize the mouse.<br /><br />She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.<br /><br />I comply downloading and then starting the installation process.  It wants to restart the system.  OK, I restart the computer.  After logging back into Windows, nothing happens.  The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151.  Ah!  Why did I have to restart?  What was the purpose of the restart.  Nothing looks different, so why the restart?<br /><br />The Logitech support person says to start the installer again.  It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue.  WHAT THE F*******?<br /><br />Honestly:<br />** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?<br />** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?<br /><br />It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations.  Why?  She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it.  This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller.  She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.<br /><br />She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.<br /><br />She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices.  I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.<br /><br />Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling.  (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).)  I use the headset with Discord, games, etc.  I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff.  Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?<br /><br />I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet.  All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse.  I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button.  Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.<br /><br />Bottom line:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.<br /><br /> ***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).<br /> ***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.<br /> ***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?<br /><br />I will update this review should Logitech get back to me.  I'll gladly let you know how it goes.<br /><br />UPDATE 1:  I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues.  The mouse is running in default mode.  I have seen two hardware issues.<br /><br />1)  I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub.  I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great!  It moved and the G was lit.<br /><br />The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen.  The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen.  Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.<br /><br />I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub.  Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.<br /><br />2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs.  I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).<br /><br />Again the bottom line hasn't changed:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.<br /><br />Final update:  Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35!  I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.<br /><br />Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working.  Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105.  The answer is yet another piece of software to run.<br /><br />Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)?

So that said…<br /><br />I’ve purchased this mouse twice, and I gotta say…. I his mouse has taken physical abuse better than any gaming peripheral I’ve ever seen.  It even worked when mostly broken.<br /><br />When it’s not broken it works fantastic as well.  Accurate, super customizable, wonderfully ergonomic if you have giant weight lifting meat claws like me.<br /><br />They come in wireless and light versions too (it is a bit on the heavy side if you have string bean arms).<br /><br />Anyway, it only makes sense the 502 replace the MX518 as my favorite mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG4YKTZYKH2GAPUMUI5FSCG5QGGA,1633593179095,0,True

Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators.<br />7.) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model.  16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh.<br />8.) Rubberized areas can handle greasy, salty gamer hands lol (see pics.)....they are the most durable grips I have ever seen in my 30 years of using mice.<br /><br />:: CONS ::<br />((FAILED)) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE - The older version I have is more reliable after 3 years.  Logitech products across the board are having durability issues.  Their OLDER 2015 - 2018 Products were far superior.  Not sure what is going on with their design and quality control, but after MANY years and thousands of dollars of products there is a noticeable DROP in QUALITY & more specifically DURABILITY.  ((Possibly they are too trick for their own good)<br /><br />1.) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one. (It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO.)<br />2.) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements.<br />3.) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode.<br />4.) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming.  Some rolling can occur, but you gotta be really shaking it.<br /><br />:: OVERALL :: I HATE CORDS, but I love this mouse so I am always torn between both worlds. I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play!<br /><br />I have purchased 3 of them now, 2 of which have HEAVY use & abuse....they still work perfectly and remain accurate. Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock. It's a gaming AND business must have. Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true.<br /><br />DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS!?!?

3.0,Buttons in odd places,"First thing I noticed, the free spinning of the scroll wheel is completely useless.  I thought for a moment I was going to have to return the mouse, then realized there's a button to turn off free spin.  But!  Then it's super clunky, better, not great.  Continuing with the scroll wheel, using the associated button is hit or miss.  I play FPS shooters and this is a button I use often.  Half the time it seems to not trigger until I let go of pushing it and then the timing is completely off, obviously.<br /><br />The three buttons on the left side of the mouse:  I have decent sized hands, I'm 6'1""  I have to reach back with my thumb to get to one of them (most used of course) and this is super uncomfortable.  There's a sticky area for grip by your thumb that really should have been the place to put the side mouse buttons, they would have been much easier to use.<br /><br />The movement seems fine so far.  The issues really stem from button placement and a VERY horrible scroll wheel.<br /><br />I would not get this mouse again even though it's #1 in computer mice category at the time of this review.  I don't know if I can return it after a couple weeks use, but, I'm going to see.<br /><br />For reference, I came from a Logitech MX518 and wanted more buttons which is what brought me to this mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHJCIMFNDWK5LAZT4IPKJL7KG4QQ,1645969478631,0,True

I have since then tossed that one away and replaced my home Mouse with another standard G502. Both of my standard G502s have worked perfectly for me.

And it kind of clunks the top most weight around when I make a flick da wrissss. Just a noise though, not an actual problem. Definetely took my accuracy in games, and put it where it should have been this whole time. Use to miss shots all the time because my 10$ wireless mouse obviously didn't have the hero sensor. Got use to the extra buttons over time and it's made fortnites building concept more convienent for me. And the software is easy to learn from Logitech. Programming buttons on the mouse to act as other keys from the keyboard, or even multi-key shortcuts. Plus the 3 different profiles in the programming option makes it easy to switch from my fortnite dpi, to my casual internet browsing dpi, as well as my button lay out being different on all 4 profiles. Totally worth the 80$. But if you're on a budget, and need to see that extra 30 bucks, the previous version is going to be practically the exact same thing. Enjoy.

The mouse feels great to use, but know that you will have to purchase a new one annually as the mouse certainly WILL develop double clicking and/or scroll wheel issues. I prefer the G502 feel over every other mouse I have tried, so I am on my 4th mouse. I look for sales and purchase them when under $50. To me it is worth having a mouse which is comfortable in my hand but I will have to repurchase vs. paying $100-200 for a mouse that I probably would have had to replace in this time frame anyway.

I personally use 2 of the weights, one on the back and one on the front. This makes moving the mouse side to side a breeze, and moving it up and down take just a few grams more effort, which is ideal for shooters and other games. My $6 mouse functioned fine, and still does, but does not have the tactile feel, profile options, macro abilities, and even the DPI settings that it have just don't feel nearly as good as the Hero does.

While gaming, I’ll be moving around, then will remove my hand COMPLETELY from the mouse. But my screen will still zoom in or move around as if I was still moving it. And I’ve made the sure wheel is not moving, nothing is moving. But it continues to do this day after day on at least two of my games. Also just realized (when I was on Logitech's site looking at possible ways to fix this) that the mouse is supposed to light up on the side piece as well, not just the Logitech symbol. Mine is not. So this makes me wonder now if I DO in fact have a defective product. I'll give it a go for a couple more days, but if the scrolling issue doesn't get resolved, I'll be sending it back. I did just turn on the switch to stop the wheel from free spinning, just in case that was the issue, though I'm sure it was not, as I made sure it was not spinning when the zooming/unzooming has happened. Otherwise this mouse is awesome. That’s the only reason for the 3 stars. The mouse fits comfortably to my hand, feels great, and has great response times.<br /><br />**Update** I have sent this back. The lights on the side randomly come on. The zooming got a little better once I locked the wheel, but part of the reason for having it was the free spinning.

3.0,LOVE the G502's (owned multiple) BUT that middle mouse click on this HERO version :-( **EDITED**,"First off, I'm biased.  I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years.  Bought back when they were in the $100 range.  Loved the mouse.  So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged.  Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme.  Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version.  Weird.<br /><br />Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way.  Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing.  Oh well.  I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine.<br /><br />**EDIT** 12/25/19<br />Have to send this back for a replacement.  The mouse wheel buttons are defective.  If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly).  The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch.  They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button.  Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502.  My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use.<br /><br />**EDIT** 12/27/19<br />First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly!  Great customer service.  Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem.  You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously.  I hope I am explaining this right.  I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right.  I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well.  I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH22EBG2F2OTXUYFILOIVVWZTROA,1577148809900,1,True

That one came, but the USB cord was so deformed coming out the front of it the mouse would stand-up on the mouse pad.  I tried to just straighten the cord, but it kept deforming and causing high friction against the mouse pad.  So I returned that one again, and the 3rd mouse was another Hero that is acceptable.

2.0,Whack,"I really wanted to love this mouse. This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs. I also am a contrarian in still liking heavier mice, despite the recent trend in favor of ultra-light mice, and this thing feels nice and solid with the weights added. Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED. Having run the gamut of wireless mice, I have found no matter what the claims are, they always are prone to connection glitches and, even when they work well for a time, are a PITA to always remember to keep charged. The new hero sensor is also awesome.<br /><br />Because of these desirable properties I lived in a state of denial about the mouse's many glaring flaws for months.<br /><br />Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief.<br /><br />The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel. It just sucks. The mouse semi-regularly just decides the scroll wheel is being clicked, resulting in lots of odd behavior. And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel.<br /><br />The free-wheeling mode of the scroll wheel is reasonably nice, with a satisfying long spin, but it's almost impossible not to occasionally click the button that puts it back into incremental scrolling mode. This is a big deal, because the incremental scrolling mode is unbelievably ghastly and thus something you would never use voluntarily The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile. At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time. The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound.<br /><br />A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement.  The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right? One would think so. However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach. You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused.<br /><br />So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHVWY5W442MPCIXY4VPB3RODLJCA,1546810143009,48,True

Suddenly, when dragging a window, the left click input would drop the window. Then when scrolling through a webpage, the wheel doesn't do anything.

Even with the lighting off it draws too much power to run off the USB hub in my keyboard, so it needs a powered hub or plugged directly into the PC.<br /><br />I will put it this way, I just ordered the parts to rebuild my older gaming mice, just a left mouse button failure on both.

4.0,Quality of Logitech degraded over the decade quate significantly. Scroll wheel unbearable ruttle.,"I had logitech mice for decades and I want to tell you that quality of Logitech is degrading over the years :( Sad but true. The best wuality mouse from Logitech I had was mighty old MX300. If you saw a circuit board itself you would be amased, it is still alive after ages of wuake 3 and counterstrike battles. My mouse before this one was G500, good wuality compared to this G502, but not for ky style of play and holding the mouse, but quality much higher then of G502.<br />Now lets talk about G502, plastic is much cheaper feeling compared to G500, and regarding scrollwheel it is Awful! First of all it grinds like a grinder and it has so much rattle when playing that I was forced to change the scroll wheel, transplanted it from G500. G500s scroll wheel is perfect quality.<br />We will see how it copes with my play, but I am afraid it wont last forever like my trusty old MX300.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gV1fMd3EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gV1fMd3EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gV1fMd3EL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGHQE2LTYK5J73CIY76GSSKR6WVA,1576941206347,0,True

I have spent hours jumping through hoops to document the issue even though it's widely publicized. I have gone so far as to recording a video of the issue with the mouse and serial number in the screen and it was still met with disbelief and hassle. I was told that a ticket number, which was not provided, was not in the video. After clearing my desk to have several different attempts at this video, I have attempted to contact supervisors to no avail.

This gives us even more buttons.<br />Cons:<br />  * There are two buttons close to the scroll button, but you can only program one. The other one is to lock/unlock the wheel. Even after using this mouse for weeks, I still hit that button, which makes the scroll roll freely. I hate it.<br />  * There are two other buttons on the left side of the right click. They are used as DPI up/DPI down. To me they are hard to reach, so I don't use them, but every now and then I hit them by accident, which changes the DPI sensitivity and mess up the game.

Given the button defect, the mouse is being returned.<br />2--The new Logitech 9.02 gaming software is a pain in the neck and worked so poorly that I uninstalled it and reverted to a prior version of the software that is far more user-friendly.<br />3--The mouse wheel has a slippery graphite feel, which is somewhat surprising for a mouse built for exact mouse movement.<br />4--The “user documentation” that came with the mouse was limited to a few small stick figures with text so small that I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it.

The mouse itself has good build quality, crisp clicks and a good amount of programmable buttons. A nice touch is the infinite scroll wheel ability, but I do not like the side to side feature of the middle mouse button. This causes the middle mouse button to rattle when moving your mouse quickly and it feels off. Another major issue for me is the weight, it is way heavy for an FPS mouse. Finally, the ergonomics is very counter intuitive. The sniper button is way too close to the thumb, and the left grips follow the shape of the thumb, which is what you don't want as it can slip out of your hand easily.

5.0,An awesome all around gaming mouse.,"Purchased for a friend as a birthday gift since his older Logitech mouse (I believe it was around six years old) started to experience an issue with the right mouse button. After messing it with off and on since I use his computer occasionally I feel I have enough experience with the mouse to write a review but I wanted to be to be clear that this mouse is not my daily.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />  Build quality and ergonomics feel solid and I felt no discomfort even after several hours of use whether the activity be gaming or just browsing. Actuation force needed for top and side buttons is minimal with average travel distance although I do feel a difference between the left and right top buttons when I press down but I think that has more to do with me than anything. Clicks are audible but not loud enough to be distracting. The top cover is not one solid shell so Left and Right mouse buttons have individual tops. If you game competitively (especially playing FPS) this is a must have feature. My Razer Lancer TE is a one piece top shell and feels sluggish compared to the G502 Hero when playing games like CS:GO Valorant and Overwatch. Buttons are mappable (to be fair almost all gaming mice can do this) and the mouse has a DPI clutch that can be used to adjust quickly for precision shooting and then resets back to the previous setting quickly. Weight is adjustable if you want to customize. I recommend maxing it out and then removing the weights in stages to see what works for you. Finally the heart of the mouse is the Pixart PMW3366 sensor that is usually found in higher end mice ($75 and up) and is what helps the G502 it punch above its weight when it comes to optics.<br /><br />  RGB is present on the mouse but it is very minimal with only the G symbol and the DPI selection indicators being illuminated (can be turned off in software). The Logitech software (G HUB) has in my opinion one of the best UI's I have ever used and is generally easier to use when compared to the other RGB/control software I have used from some other companies. I also have a G910 Orion Spectrum I use as a secondary keyboard and G HUB works well with that too. When it comes to procedures like creating key bindings, making/saving profiles, and customizing the RGB it works quite well. Finally, the price which generally hovers around $50 which is more than fair for a quality mouse that will last you for years.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />  RGB again is very minimal which could be an issue depending on visual taste. The mouse is kinda small and that could be an issue for someone with large hands especially if you experience discomfort with the thumb rest as you might find yourself pressing DPI clutch in the middle of a fire fight. It does have very gamer look going on which can be a turn off for some. The free flowing scroll wheel with clutch can seem out of place for some since this is marketed as a gaming mouse. I really wish they squeezed in at least one (preferably two) side buttons for the right side of the mouse. General lack of buttons could be an annoyance for games like a MMORPG.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br /> I nit picked with the cons but in reality this is a very good general purpose gaming mouse that is geared more towards the FPS crowd. The only reason I could see someone wanting something different are for aesthetic reasons, they play games that this mouse is not really built for, they want a higher end e-sports type mouse, or they have a suite of peripherals that are from a different brand. Some people like to keep the number of  control software running to a minimal. Still if you are getting into gaming or have been doing it for years Logitech generally makes good stuff. I know when it comes time for me to upgrade my own peripherals I might find myself jumping ship from Razer and giving Logitech for daily use.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ijYA7-IAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ijYA7-IAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ijYA7-IAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHWBRSPNEDSFE4CEB6WER2LMLUOQ,1598325725343,0,False

1.0,Awkward mouse. Low quality,"I’m surprised at how good this mouse is rated. I haven’t owned too many mice, but I can say this one is the worst. I’d prefer an out of the box mouse you get with a new pc over this garbage. The mouse is pretty narrow and doesn’t fit my hand well at all. I have med-large hands (not huge hands). The button placement is quite annoying, especially the thumb button. I’m constantly hitting it by accident when I move the mouse to the right. The dpi buttons look and feel similar to the other buttons next to it and intuitively feel backwards from what they are… granted, I can probably reprogram this in the software. Honestly, the only thing I like about this mouse is the Logitech software. If the mouse falls, it flys apart since it’s held together with magnets. Also, after it fell, the roller is now practically unusable since even just a light touch intended to scroll will now middle click. My left click started sticking after just a couple months making it a terrible gaming mouse. I’d recommend avoiding this mouse unless you have tiny hands that won’t keep hitting the extra buttons placed where a normal person grips. When my bro hops on my pc he tells me every time how bad this mouse sucks!

4.0,"Great mouse for price, some issues","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid.  You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.<br /><br />I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came.  They are pretty much the same shape design.  Only a couple of differences with the hardware.  First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core.  This is hands down.  However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same.  I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'.  I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly.  I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.<br /><br />I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot.  It was very comfortable for me to hold.  Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way.  Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.<br /><br />In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid.  Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me.  I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years).  I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.<br /><br />Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel.  The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'.  Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment.  This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches.  I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse.  Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses.  I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this.  You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes.  Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better.  I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me.  I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.<br /><br />So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4.  The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFdm5AeiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFdm5AeiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LFdm5AeiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AE2EOHI4D36UYTHSFUBZV7E2ZCEA,1647876300547,11,True

1.0,HEAVY Total BRICK,"This mouse came out before the lightweight gaming mouse trend when many people thought ""ohhh its heavy so it must be quality"". This is not the case. Just like how racecars and airplanes take slavery measure they can to reduce weight to increase performance, the same holds true for gaming mice. This mouse weighs like130 grams and feels like an absolute brick. And what's really funny is that's without the included extra weights to make it even heavier. After using tons of different mice I've realized that a true high performance gaming mouse has to be like 85 grams MAX, ideally less than 70, the 50 gram cooler master mice feel the best in my opinion. Due to its weight its 100% not useable as a gaming mouse where quick reflexes are paramount, you will never match the reflexes of an opponent with a lightweight mouse, or even a productivity mouse where long hours at the computer with a heavy mouse can cause fatigue. The build quality is good, clicks feel top notch, but the cable is stupidly stiff and be prepared to buy a replacement after 1-2 years when the rubberized side grip gets gross and wears down to a shine. I would never ever buy one of these again and I strongly reccomend you dont either. If it weighed 70 grams or less and had a more flexible cable it would be worth considering, but in it's current state it's a big fat NO.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AE565SJ3JZUH3RJLSTWT4BPPAGGA,1660928744061,0,False
5.0,Great mouse,"This mouse is comfortable and precise. The G glows too, and you can change the color. My only complaint is the positioning of navigation buttons. I accidentally click the back because it is located next to the thumb rest, but I'm pretty sure that can be disabled, and it is useful in some games. Sometimes I bump the dpi setting buttons against the side of my keyboard if I run out of room, but that's on me for not allowing enough space. Aside from that, it's everything I want in a mouse. My favorite feature is the mouse wheel is unlockable. You've got your normal clicky mouse wheel scrolling, but you can unlock it to make the wheel free-spinning. This is extremely useful in any game with a semi-auto weapon and a high fire rate (faster than you can normally click).

5.0,Great mouse for the price,"I got this to replace my well used G700. First impressions were ""Wow this is light!"" I then remembered the weights and added all of them. I like a mouse with some heft as I don't play games needing twitch reflexes. While there is one less thumb button, the three that are there are easier for me to hit when needed. The two buttons to the left of the left mouse button are far easier to use than the ones on my old mouse as well. I was a little worried about the shallower curve across the top at first, but have discovered that when using my wrist wrest, it actually keeps my wrist in a better position than the G700 did. Setup using the Gaming Software was familiar and gave no issues. I can't speak to the advantages of the sensor because I don't really play the sorts of games where that would matter. It certainly tracks fine on my black mouse mat. Finally, I appreciate that the RGB aspect is restrained to just the logo which is covered when I'm actually using it. I considered just shutting it off as I'm not a huge fan, but it has turned out to be useful as an indicator of which profile I have active.

5.0,Finally retiring that Corsair,"The G502 is replacing two faulty Corsairs - the M65 Pro RGB and the Harpoon RGB. Both are having typical left click failures, so I wanted something heavy with a larger footprint like the M65.<br /><br />Logitech got a lot right with this design, which is why I'm not surprised it hasn't changed much over the years. The ability to add weights is a huge plus for me since I love a large, heavy mouse for some weird reason. The magnetic flap is one of my favorite design choices as well - it's dead simple and honestly really cool.<br /><br />The scroll wheel is solid and tactile, and provides a rewarding click when using. With the scroll button disengaged, the scroll wheel is buttery smoooooth. I definitely dig it, especially because this mouse pulls double-duty between my gaming PC and my work laptop.<br /><br />Honestly, the only issue I've found is that DPI switches positioned essentially on the left click (G7 and G8) can prove to be an annoyance if you miss the click and unintentionally increase/decrease the DPI.  I think this issue is mainly on me, though. I change up my grips periodically, so it's really just acclimatizing to the mouse at this point.<br /><br />Overall, I really dig the G502. I've always avoided Logitech products because of their ""office"" products, but this mouse has definitely exceeded my expectations so far. Since I'm still breaking it in, I'll probably update this review if it starts doing anything wonky.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGG7W3SOMP7YJ7SJGB5I4732XM6A,1615838072630,0,True

A couple things<br />-- I'm kinda iffy on the mouse wheel being metal and not having a rubber grip like the G500.  I can see why people are accidentally pressing the middle mouse key when they scroll the wheel, it's really slippery.<br />-- Also, the form factor is for a small person with small hands or something. Not sure how they don't know that you make a claw when you use a mouse, not lay your hand flat and that forward thumb button is too far forward.<br />-- One last thing, the door on the bottom where you put the weights is magnetic and seems like it comes off super easy.

4.0,Nice mouse. Very close to perfect.,"For reasons that I still haven't figured out, my KVM quit working with my Logitech wireless mouse when I changed the monitor stand. It makes no sense at all, but that's what happened. The KVM manufacturer doesn't recommend wireless mice anyway, so I started searching for a wired mouse. Gaming mice seem to have the best features, so I decided to go that route. I went through a couple of other brands/models and they just didn't work for me. They had weird button layouts or the ergonomics weren't quite right for me. I finally decided to quit wasting time and went for this Logitech, which has been my go-to brand for decades.<br />I like this mouse. It has more buttons and features than I need, but better that than not enough. It was a little bit of a challenge to get the software installed, but I finally got that to work. I'm not a fan of the disco lights on computers these days, but those can be turned off, so I did. I like the feel of the mouse. It's adjustable if you want a heavier/lighter mouse. The buttons have a distinctive ""click"" but aren't overly loud. My keyboard is far louder.<br />I only have 2 cons. I wish the shape was more like the Logitech M720. That mouse fits my hand so much better. The buttons on the M720 slope down farther which helps pull my wrist up in a straighter position. I also don't like the metal wheel on this mouse. Although it is grooved, it still feels slippery. I would prefer one that isn't quite so smooth.<br />All-in-all, this is a great mouse.

5.0,Best mouse hands down!,"There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!<br /><br />1) Daily use<br />Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:<br /> - Fits incredibly well around your hand<br /> - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use<br />  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.<br /> - Great grip<br /> - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software<br /><br />2) Gaming<br />When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:<br /> - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!<br /> - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)<br /> - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!<br /><br />*** Update ***<br />The mouse is durable  and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGNFCZJAMTIES4R3FEJ4PD7YUISA,1615754585581,17,True

The extra mouse buttons helps with secondary roles like switching optics and fire select modes.<br /><br />Very comfortable mouse to use and the Logitech app is very easy to use and navigate.

2.0,Solid mouse with long term reliability issues,"I've had this for a bit over 3 years and switches are failing. The LMB switch is having an apparently common issue with not registering clicks or registering them as double clicks, and being generally bad. The wheel is also having some failed registers, both issues occurring within the same month. I've owned a dozen mice over my life, and this is the first that's had the issue. I tried opening the case up and cleaning it with compressed air, but that was not helpful. If it was just the LMB switch I might consider replacing the one, but with the wheel going bad as well, I won't.<br /><br />Their online support is bad as well. It's all bots with delay tactics. They won't do anything if it's out of warranty, which I guess is to be expected, but the warranty period is short.<br /><br />It's otherwise an excellent gaming mouse, though given how I hold one I'd prefer the ""slow down"" button was more aft, but I guess I don't ""use it right"" or something.<br /><br />5-star if they had good QC and customer service, unfortunately both are trash, so 2 stars and realize you're buying a designed obsolescence mouse from an untrustworthy brand.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFHHQVGLFPBDUKVRKG265AIJHL6Q,1676501355568,0,True

The mouse wheel will rattle when the mouse is moved quickly, and is too easy to bump to the right and left, while difficult to press downward. The scrolling wasn't smooth either.

I couldn't do this with my Corsair Glaive Pro and tbh, spending $60 then compared to this made me regret everything. The program that comes with this mouse is foreign at first, but in the end, gets simple to use. I have both the Ique (Corsiar keyboard) paired with this mouse and both run great with each other. This app like the ique (program for corsair), can both pair games to profile, so as you launch the game, it switches to that specific profile without you having to change the macros all the time.<br /><br />I personally dont like the looks, but the utility of this mouse, makes me love the heck out of this.

1.0,Persistent issues,"Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number. The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again.<br /><br />TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use.<br /><br />I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core. The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software.<br /><br />My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured. With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse. I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software. When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the ""Downloading and Installing"" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour. After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict. Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time. Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured.<br /><br />Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally. To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core. The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software.<br /><br />Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there. In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary. This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600,  and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal. In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point.<br />Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself. With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning.<br /><br />Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support. After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later. Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it.<br /><br />It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down.<br /><br />I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFYRNJWTTEHCTUG4IQERWZHWK7KQ,1566416387890,9,True

You have two options: rock hard or complete freewheel. After using it for a few weeks I determined that the ""rock hard"" setting became tiresome when scrolling through webpages and that the freewheel setting enabled quick scrolling. However, when in freewheel, the wheel has a terrible tendency to have backlash, most likely due to the sensor design. I haven't encountered any broken switches or movements, but suspect several of the reports of ""broken wheels"" may be due either to the user not realizing the mode is toggled by the (undocumented) toggle ""button"" just below the wheel or using the ""button"" as a brake in freewheel mode, which I found will likely cause the ratcheting mechanism to bind and break.<br />Another somewhat disappointing feature of the wheel is that the left and right scroll wheel movements are single clicks rather than repeating, which requires repeated clicking left or right to scroll instead of having a continuous movement like older Logitech mice did. I found the left-right scroll doesn't work with all programs either (Excel being one), which was also a disappointment.<br />Another recent discovery is that, like the Corsair I had previously, recent updates to their software can cause severe system crashes, which has led me to disable updating altogether. Attempts to alert the company to this issue met with a canned response, leading me to believe they're not too concerned about the quality of their driver software, which is unfortunate.<br />This would be a five-star mouse if the scroll wheel was improved and if we didn't have to worry about a driver software update completely breaking our systems without warning.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHBVMGUFYBPBXWIQRNWBCUNGXMBQ,1628313423031,0,True

So, what I do is use the G Hub for button assignments making sure the setting are saved in the on board (mouse) memory, and immediately uninstall G Hub.

I'm not a gamer, I use this mouse for work mostly doing data analysis and TSQL, so my wants & needs are quite a bit different than most.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Since the weights are customizable, I still get to have the nice heavy mouse I've always loved.<br />- Granular DPI adjustments let me set up the speed just how I like it and lets me pick and choose just the right places for the 9,485 screenshots I need to take daily to show people why they're wrong.<br />- All buttons are able to be unassigned, so if you're not a gamer and you're worried about hitting the wrong thing, don't, it's not a big deal.<br />- The lighting is totally customizable, so if you don't want to see cool glowing lights on your mouse, don't.

I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain.<br />- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button).  It's kind of loud.  Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500.<br />- The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove.

The scroll wheel is so smooth, without any clicking when in hyperscroll mode. The only downside to the wheel when in hyperscroll mode, is that it’s very sensitive. When you pick up the mouse to reposition it on the mouse pad, the wheel rolls a little, which in turn scrolls your page online. When not in hyperscroll, the wheel clicks are much more pronounced than a traditional mouse. Not a fan. The box does not come with any instructions for all the various buttons and settings.

2.0,Logitech mice aren't what they used to be - Bad Return Policy for $60+ mice,"Many years ago Logitech was the go-to brand for computer peripherals but for the last decade my experience with their mice has been quite poor. I have Logitech webcams that after many years are still great, an illuminated keyboard that's lasted a decade and a 5.1 speaker set that's lasted even longer. My first Logitech mouse the 518 similarly lasted many years before the middle mouse button started to fail. Next I replaced it with another one which failed within a year. After that I went to a G400 that within 2 years started to have button fails / produce the double click error. Maybe it's a fluke, got another G400. Failed at about a year. Will try the G502, again not even a whole year before it started failing along with the double click error. 2nd G502 - same result 1 year. This is in a dry, temperature controlled, clean environment with no liquids or foods being spilled on it. I've already gotten the new out of retirement version of the Mx518 but if it produces the same result I'm looking elsewhere for my next mouse.<br /><br />Update: I tried to return the two mice I had that were within warranty. Logitech wants you to record yourself clicking the mouse over 100 times on a 3rd party site designed to check for double clicks while holding the serial number in the frame. That's just the first step of the potential return process. No more Logitech mice for me. The double click issue is well know enough by Logitech to already have a process in place for you, not them to document it, then they know its a widespread issue and should stop wasting the customers time.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGO6QUDDB2TCFEH7L64BUC6ZPDMA,1596863384378,4,True

1.0,A Worthy Purchase with Unforeseen Flaws,"As a Logitech User I was already satisfied with the G502 Proteus Core though of course over the years the wiring's mesh has frayed so I thought to get a new one and seeing the Hero as only a minor upgrade at a fair price than my original purchase I proceeded to grab it.<br /><br />It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit.<br /><br />For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off.<br /><br />UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a ""reliable"" solution to yet. In short, over the past couple months I've noticed an odd increase in input from the mouse (sudden multi-clicks) when I was playing Osu! (Rhythm Game I occasionally play) as the ripple indicator as well my Mouse Key Input Tab was registering more hits than usual, even when Click+Dragging for the game.<br /><br />Before this, I was having some similar issues while playing games on my emulator where my click and drag would reset and interrupt the gameplay. The notable bit is the pressure put on the mouse whether it be lightly pressed or firmly pressed and even after testing the hardware with a click test it now registers that every 10/100 Clicks a double input would occur if pressed lightly though when ""mashing"" the results increase (20-24/100 Clicks) which has me puzzled at what needed to be done.<br /><br />Overall, the mouse is ""usable"" though for high intensity applications that require precision and such I would not recommend grabbing this mouse as its lifespan was barely over a year and not at all satisfactory for the consumer.<br /><br />UPDATE: So I attempted to rectify the issue again though after some more time had passed, there is a notable hardware issue with this mouse where your ""left"" clicks registers multiple times with it's sensitive clicking which is a hinderance to ""active"" games like Osu! which require precise clicks and dragging at high speeds. Even playing on emulators is stifling to do where you have to resort to registering your main clicks with the ""right"" button instead of the usual left button.

First and most aggravating is the mouse wheel. When I scroll with it, once I stop scrolling, it either goes too far or it goes backwards. I hate that. It has no clicks and is completely smooth rolling so you can't feel where you're supposed to stop. It's especially noticeable when I'm reading either Kindle for PC or Nook for PC because you use the mouse wheel to change pages and it will either skip ahead or go back a page every single time.

That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use.<br /><br />That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list.<br />Pros:<br />- Solid construction<br />- good button placement<br />- buttons are light, and crisp<br />- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub.<br />- Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features.<br />Cons:<br />- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip.<br />- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)<br />- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights. If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams.<br />- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review. Would be nice to have like Roccats swarm software.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a well priced product. The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie). It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip. I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD. I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEKE4TMYCOABDRALAXGGFY4EASRA,1543974457531,9,True

2.0,"While it's a good mouse, I don't feel it holds up to its ""gaming mouse"" status","The mouse itself is fine. Customizable and good remapping, but where it fails is the ""Gaming mouse"" portion. The whole concept of a gaming mouse is to make it as ergonomic as possible. Several of the key buttons fail to do so spectacularly. While the mouse wheel being 2 different buttons for left and right pushing is a nice feature, I feel like there is a lot lost in some of the other buttons with how you need to basically curl your finger into your hand to reach them. It makes it rather difficult to use the buttons seamlessly since you basically have to reposition your entire hand to reach them.<br /><br />It was a nice try, but style does not beat efficiency.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGBXJ2HHRYPD4LW4H3DYHABWNIIA,1557522791974,1,True
5.0,Slight improvements to an already great mouse,"I have no idea why Amazon wants me to rate the battery life on this wired mouse. That was kind of weird.<br /><br />In any case, this is a continued evolution of the G502 mouse, which debuted as the Proteus Core, then the Proteus Spectrum before being released as the Hero. The Spectrum introduced RGB lighting to the fold and the Hero introduces the improved Hero sensor, otherwise, all 3 variants are virtually identical aside from a couple aesthetic touches (the Core has some blue accents on it and the Hero has a slightly different G logo).<br /><br />In terms of performance, if you've used any of the previous G502 mice before, it won't feel much different to you. In fact, there's very little reason to upgrade to this unless you just happen to have the money to spare. The Hero sensor is an improved sensor, but I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between this and the previous sensor. I still use the Spectrum version on my other build and the Core at work, and they all feel the same.<br /><br />Mouse design is the same, button placement is the same, and overall, it feels the same.<br /><br />Which is great because the G502 is just a great mouse, unless you like light mice. It is already on the heavy side and can be made heavier with weights that Logitech includes. For competitive shooters, this mice probably isn't ideal, but if you like heavier mice, this one fits the bill. I like a heavy mouse, so it works for me.<br /><br />Button clicks are responsive and satisfying and the metallic scroll wheel is one of my favorites. The ability to adjust DPI on the fly is nice, as is the sniper button on the side right in front of where your thumb would rest. It has a number of different buttons that can be completely adjusted in the Logitech Gaming Software and the RGB lighting is not nearly as intrusive as on some mice and can be completely disabled if you wish.<br /><br />Some complain about the braided cable snagging, but I have not readily run into this issue much. In fact, it's only an issue when I leave something on my desk for it to snag on.<br /><br />I really like this mouse, but as with anything else, it isn't for everyone. But I personally would recommend it, especially if you like heavier mice.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEYLHX62INLVPWKUCJFP2WILNVHQ,1547326544816,16,True

1.0,Two mice failed from the same design flaw (double-click issues) in under two years!,"I loved the Logitech G502 Hero at first. I bought two of them from a local retailer in February 2020, after building new computers for my husband and me at the end of 2019. The look is really nice, adjustable weight is customizable and the ergonomic design feels really good in the hand. Unfortunately, that's where the positives of this mouse end!<br /><br />A little after a year from purchase, the left mouse button on my mouse began to register most single clicks as double clicks, rendering the mouse basically useless. Since I used the programmable features (in art/illustration programs, more than gaming) and had custom profiles set up, while my husband didn't, he gave me his mouse and bought himself one without the programmable features. That was in August. Here we are, just four months later, and this mouse is experiencing the exact same issue! Left-button clicks are continuously registering as double clicks, making the mouse unusable.<br /><br />As much as Ioved the appearance and functionality of this mouse, these ongoing double-click issues are unacceptable! I'm now on the search for another weighted, programmable mouse that hopefully doesn't suffer from the same design flaw. I will not buy this mouse again and suggest that anyone looking for durable, reliable mouse look elsewhere. This one, sadly, is just not it.<br /><br />** If you found this review helpful, please mark it helpful to let me know and help other buyers.

The G502 is fantastic but the mouse wheel makes it very difficult to use. It is just too slippery. For normal browsing it is fine but for anything requiring precision it does not work.

4.0,Great mouse but not for claw grips,"This mouse has a lot of good features but it wasnt for me. The ergonomic feel was interesting but for a claw grip, it made my hand cramp up. The ""infinity scroll"" is more of a gimmick than an actual useful tool. It overscrolls so much that it is pointless to even use. It is also so sensitive that just moving the mouse will trigger it to scroll. When you switch to the click scroll, it is difficult to grip because there is not rubber or material on the mouse wheel itself. My finger would slip often trying to use it. The sniper button also was too far forward for a claw grip, so i wasnt able to reach it comfortably. The other buttons were nice but not needed features. You really only need 2 side buttons for fps. And there are many other options that are lighter and cheaper (Logitech G203 for example). If you need more than 2 side buttons for MMOs or whatever, there are many more better options (Logitech G600 for example). It was also heavy for the features its providing. At 121 grams, its on the heavy side for claw grip users like me. For example the Logitech G203 is only 85 grams and many high level mice today are around 50-60 grams.<br /><br />But everything else was good with this mouse.

So I decided to order the G502 and give it a try.<br /><br />What a difference! I have slightly large hands, and even though this mouse has a slightly smaller footprint than the g602 it still fits my hand better. I mean it REALLY feels great in my hand. I tried it out with the extra weights, but I find that I actually prefer it without them.<br /><br />Bottom line is this is definitely my favorite mouse I have ever owned by a long shot.

4.0,Excellent mouse -- mostly,"I needed to replace my 11 year old G500 mouse due to wire issues.  This G502 is quite similar in design and feel.  I use it mostly for general computer use and only occasional gaming.  But there is one flaw in the design of the G502 for me... the speed of movement (DPI setting) button for ""faster"" is located so close to the left click button that I am consantly tripping it accidentally as I work.  Suddenly, the cursor is flying across the screen so fast I can't find it and I have to stop and hit the ""slower"" button to return to the speed I want.  I never had this problem with the G500 because the speed buttons were lower down the side of the mouse and never were activated by mistake.<br /><br />I do like that the extra buttons work without having to install the mouse software.  The software does add extra customization capability, but I do not need it for my uses.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this mouse.  It is well built and feels like it will last a long time.  I just hope I can train myself to not accidentally hit that poorly placed DPI button.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGTPFVU2ZNUVATZTKKELHDHCRO7A,1632858500102,1,True

5.0,An incredible mouse with damn good software,"Logitech's G502 Hero is the mouse I recommend to any friend. As long as you don't mind tinkering with the G Hub software, this mouse will carry you through everything - FPS games, MOBAs, MMOs, you name it. The sheer amount of customization is insane, especially considering the reasonable price tag. There's a plethora of buttons available, although it's worth noting that the DPI Up, DPI Down, and Profile Switch buttons can be difficult to reach and press with quick reaction times. The weight distribution is DIY with the customizable weights underneath, which I personally have filled to the brim for one heavy mouse. The RGB in the mouse isn't exactly stellar - it's not as bright as I think it could be, and colors aren't accurate to the app, but at least the colors are nice and vivid, as well as being uniform.<br /><br />The materials are all nice; the palm rest is nice and matte, the rubber on the sides is incredible, the glossy side buttons look great, the primary buttons are sturdy enough for a ragey gamer like me, and the biggest stand-out is the scroll wheel. I don't know what this thing is made of, but scrolling experience can only be described as ""impossibly satisfying"". No part of this mouse feels cheap, again surprising for the price point.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful mouse. No expense seems to have been spared in designing this piece of work, no compromise made. Easily an S-tier mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG2IPIMSTQD6PY2TB4JVAEFZ2M6A,1652138369341,0,True

The ""shift"" button doesn't get much use, it's rather awkward and nearly pointless.<br /><br />The software is OK, but with one game it randomly swaps back and forth between Mouse-4/Mouse-5 and R/T... leading to too many unnecessary deaths.<br /><br />Overall, because of the expense and the failing mouse button, buy something else.

In order to be able to use them for console (at least for xbox) for anything other than dpi adjustment, you will need to download the Logitech program on a computer and re-map those buttons. I found some videos for it on youtube but long story short, you will need to map those 3 dpi buttons to another button on the keyboard that you don't use for gaming. Once you've done that, go to the mouse and keyboard button mapping settings on whatever game you are playing and map those random keyboard buttons that you set the dpi buttons to, to whatever you actions you want it to complete. For example, if you want the dpi increase button to be ""reload"", on your computer, map that dpi increase button to, let's say, ""["". Then open up your game settings on your console and map ""reload"" to ""["". Then when you press the dpi increase button on your mouse, the console will think you are clicking ""["", and your ge will recognize ""["" as how you want to reload and will reload.<br /><br />The YouTube videos are probably easier to understand, but hey, I tried.

I've had this mouse for just over a year and a half (and another Logitech trackball previously). Just like my previous Logitech hardware, the buttons are sub-par.<br /><br />When it was working correctly, I enjoyed using this mouse.  It has buttons place where they are easily used ""reachable"" and worked pretty well for what I intended.  However, it is having the same ""press the left mouse button once it automatically double clicks issue"" that my previous trackball developed.  I believe this is an ongoing (YEARS) issue with Logitech and their particular buttons.<br /><br />I ordered a similar mouse form another manufacturer.  Hopefully, it will be better than this.  This was my last Logitech purchase.

I tried to contact logitech but they can't be bothered to answer the phone or get back to an email. The only fix I could find was to pull the button up gently and then press it back down hard and that fixed it for a while.

The wheel has 2 settings, free wheel and click scroll, however, the free wheel is so lose that if you are gaming it causes issues such as weapon swapping.

Very few speak a reasonable version of English probably because they all seem to be out of Panama City. They prefer to interface via email so they can keep you hanging or they can find someone who knows what they are doing.<br /><br />For the first 3 models, I finally figured out that external hard drives connected to your system interferes with their wireless mice.<br /><br />That's why this current unit is wired. It fits my ""large"" had well and allowed me to program it easily. I am supposed to be able to save that programming to their servers but that does not work.

It also feels incredibly cheap, especially the scroll wheel which feels very flimsy. The scroll wheel is also annoyingly loud when not in frictionless mode. It does not have a smooth clicking sound like the G700s, but sounds like its grinding. Frictionless mode is really loose scrolling up and down pages, far more than a G700s.<br /><br />Ergonomically its smaller than a G700s, sitting much lower and does not feel like any the older G-series mice, forcing me to uncomfortably extend my wrist. It seems like it may be better suited for a child.<br /><br />The other reviews make me question if I got the real thing. Amazon can be like Russian roulette on hardware.

I prefer how the G700s felt in my hands to this, but that's probably just personal preference. The DPI shift button (the button by the thumb) feels too far forward for me, but I probably just need to get used to it. My main issue with the mouse itself is that I find myself accidentally clicking the left mouse button pretty often with the G502, so I think buttons are quite a bit lighter/easier to press on this mouse.<br /><br />The thing that I really dislike the most about this mouse is  G Hub, the software Logitech pretty much forces you to use if you want to get the most out of the mouse. Yes, there is onboard memory for five different profiles, but it's not nearly as convenient to access and change these onboard profiles as it was with the previous Logitech software: Logitech Gaming Software. LGS was also faster, used fewer system resources, and more intuitive than G Hub. Overall, better in all the ways that count. But it looks like Logitech won't let you use the old LGS software with this mouse anymore.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty displeased with this mouse.

Even the the 2 next to the left mouse button are for DPI up and down, the square one on the side is DPI shift, and the square at the top is profile shift. You have to use G Hub to set up a profile and can assign different macros and key settings to those buttons but depending on what you are playing they may not work for the next game.

I preferred USB wired instead of wireless so no lag, however this mouse somehow not working and its freeze sometimes like out of battery. I swap to a different USB port just in case my USB not working well, but same problems occurred. Therefore the problem is not my computer USB plugs but the mouse itself.<br /><br />What's annoying is the attach piece (pictures) on the bottom easily kept come off. Happened all the times when I played Fornite, Dota, League of Legend, Valorant, and etc. When the bottom piece came off, I lost control of the mouse.  In order to prevent the bottom piece fall off, I put super glue on it. Can't believed Logitech actually designed a garbage mouse and called ""Hero"" ruining their reputation! Even its FREE, I don't even want it and my son didn't even want to use because the bottom came off easily . Now days, sitting somewhere in my junks.

3.0,Major drop in quality compared to other models,"I purchased the G502 HERO in June of 2022 after one of the feet wore out on my G502 SE HERO and began scratching my mouse pad. I've previously owned the G502 Proteus Core (non-RGB tunable) and my wife currently owns the G502 Proteus Spectrum (RGB tunable). The G502 HERO that I just purchased does not have a braided cable similar to all of the other versions. It also just feels much, much cheaper overall. The button clicks don't feel as crisp, the scroll wheel feels less sturdy, the infinite scroll doesn't work as well, and even the mouse sensor seems less responsive somehow despite claiming a 25K DPI sensor. It's much cheaper than the other versions, but I'm highly disappointed in the drastic quality difference. Overall, I would recommend purchasing one of the Proteus versions for the best quality and stay away from the G502 HERO.

3.0,"Great design, not enough customization","So, I love almost everything about this mouse, but the part I hate is what is driving me nuts. This mouse has the most sensitive scrolling wheel in the history of all scrolling wheels. It is loose (as in if you just spin it, it will keep spinning for a long time) and there is no way to reduce the sensitivity on just that. Since purchasing this mouse, I have had to disable the middle mouse button on almost all my games outside of actually pressing the button. Before then, if happen to even come in contact with the mouse well, it will zoom in or switch weapons. It happens A LOT. Also, most of the buttons are already pre-determined for sensitivity changes.

Once you figure that out, and want something that's great for claw gripping, and versatile enough to match other styles, look no further (unless you have a crazy budget and can afford the light speed wireless version).<br /><br />The only downside is that the software is required if you want any of the features.

The mechanical aspects of the wheel also are very poor, as the ""free wheel"" and the ""resistance mode"" of the mouse feel pretty much the same, resistance mode I can almost free spin the mouse to the same extent of free wheel. Added to the fact that it just feels clunky, loose, and wobbles around making a rattling sound when Im using it.

Perhaps it was just some small aspect of how they designed the body but it really felt like the fit was just off.<br /><br />The programable buttons were decent, and the software was pretty easy to figure out and worked fine, the only issue I had with it was that some of the games I have installed, very popular games, it would not recognize on a search and I had to add them in manually.<br /><br />They could also start using optical switches for the main buttons which would make me feel better about the longevity and accuracy of the item as well.<br /><br />Considering their closest competitor has made a product without these glaring flaws it may behoove Logitech to get on the ball and make some serious design changes.

I used to run the cheap G-model mouse that just has the 2 extra buttons and it was honestly FINE.  This one seemed awesome right out of the box.  It fits the hand nicely, and the extra buttons are in good spots for your fingers.  The mouse is super fast right out of the box.  Like, WAY too fast.  I had to slow down my mouse speed drastically to get back to what I am used to.  This might be a good thing for some people and I don't mind at least having the option to speed it up to ludicrous speeds if I want.  My biggest complaint is the mouse wheel.  After only playing a couple of rounds of a game, my middle finger feels like its getting calloused from the wheel.  It feels slippery, and at the same time it's rough on the finger due to the ridges on the wheel.  Actually, now that I am looking at my finger, it is peeling skin off.  I'm a chef so I do a lot of knife work.  My skin is thick for the most part so to have a mouse wheel do this to my fingers is insane.<br />At the end of the day, I'd love this mouse if it weren't for the wheel.

2.0,"Looks and Feels Nice, But Won't Last","I bought this mouse because a few reviews indicated it was both a quality product and comfortable for people with big hands.<br /><br />While the former is true, the latter is only partially true. I wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but there's something about the angle your hand rests that makes certain actions a little awkward, at least for big hands.<br /><br />Trying to mash m1 quickly, for instance, is harder than previous mouses I've owned because pressing down on a slant causes horizontal movement, however slightly. It's mitigated somewhat by the curvature of the mouse 1 button, but it's still present.<br /><br />Another problem I have is that the DPI adjustment buttons are constantly being pressed by accident, one way or the other. There might be a way to lock those down, but that complicates the accessibility of variable DPI, so it's one or the other.<br /><br />The G Hub software is bloated and generally unpleasant to use, but required for full functionality.<br /><br />After owning the mouse for about six months, the notorious g502 left-click issues began. It was spotty for a little while, but now it can't hold a click at all, making it essentially unusable.

3.0,Hard To Lift Without Activating Button,"I just cannot figure out why mouse design engineers do not consider the requirement that a mouse needs to be lifted off the pad and repositioned back to where the user's hand/wrist is not in an uncomfortable position.  Also, what to do when one runs out of mouse pad?  Why, lift the mouse and bring it back to the middle, of course.<br /><br />The G502 is a great mouse except it's difficult to use without activating one of the G4 or G5 buttons, especially when lifting to reposition.  One of the reasons for this is the sides of the mouse body are too straight up and down which cause ones fingers to slide up.  Coupled with the thumb scoop area being too small--even in normal use, ones thumb is very close to those buttons-- that in the heat of battle, they're far, far, too easy to accidentally press and, poof, you lost that battle.<br /><br />Overall the mouse seems robustly built but I feel that all of the switches activate with too light and too shallow of a press.  Otherwise, it's a great gaming mouse except the thumb scoop needs to be bigger/deeper.  Likewise (but to a lesser degree) the finger scoop on the other side of the body.

4.0,"Better than basic, but not ideal.","The first thing that I thought when I first used the mouse is it's narrow profile, which is much too narrow for the average man's hands, leaving your pinky and ring finger dragging on the desk or struggling to find room to grip the mouse. The RGB LEDs are not all that impressive because only two parts of the mouse light up. Most of the buttons are easily accessible without much finger travel though they really missed an opportunity to put buttons on the right side for increased ergonomics. The plastic and rubber feel cheap in the palm and what disappoints me the most is the use of rubber in parts of the mouse because the oils on your hand will eventually degrade it (this happened to my other logitech mouse.) Another quirk: this mouse is strongly magnetic at the bottom which causes it to stick somewhat to my stainless steel desk. This isn't a deal breaker for me because now I don't need to use the weights for added resistance but its still not something you'd expect.<br /><br />Negatives aside the mouse works as expected but for the overall build quality I would say it needs to be set at a lower price.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHDAIBFZ4DRKPIO4SFVMEK5FY2BQ,1610592948667,0,True

3.0,"Started extra clicking after 11 months, Logitech replaced it for free and...","I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years. I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse. Unfortunately on the Logitech  G502 Hero the left mouse button starts to malfunction and to click an extra time or wont hold the left mouse button down when I have my finger held down on it (to drag objects on the screen) it will release the button without me letting go of the button effectively making it impossible to drag objects across the screen. The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times.<br /><br />The Logitech G502 Hero that I purchased from Amazon for $68.29 on 04/18/2019 started experiencing the dreaded extra clicking and unable to hold the left mouse button down issues on 03/30/2020  (a little less than a year after purchase) and I contacted Logitech support which then had me follow several troubleshooting steps and film a video of the issue with my phone's camera and send it to them. Logitech replaced the original defective mouse for free on 04/05/2020 but now on 01/15/2021 the replacement mouse that Logitech sent me is starting to experience the same issue agian with the left mouse button clicking extra times and releasing the left mouse button when I have my finger held down without me letting go of the button, thats the second G502 Hero thats failed in under a year.<br /><br />Almost all the 20+ mice that I have purchased since the 1990's have been Logitech (95%) which were excellent quality and the other 5% have been Razer mice which were not as good as the Logitech mice and were overpriced. I dont really think its worth it to spend $50+ on a mouse and then have it fail at 12 months or less so this time I purchased a $20 Asus TUF M3 to replace my $68.29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it. I hope that Logitech quality improves in the future because I was reading 3 star and under reviews online for the Logitech G502 Hero and the issues that I am experiencing seem to be pretty common (it seems that the sensor that registers the clicks is made in China and is poor quality) some people mention that they replaced the sensor that registers mouse clicks with a Japanese sensor and it got rid of the issues but im not technical enough to open up the mouse, find the replacement part online, and then put it in the defective mouse so ill just buy a replacement $20 mouse from Asus.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHG6OREPK3EH7O27ODOWBJ72FF4Q,1610939789075,15,True

3.0,"Just under two years in, and I now I have the left click problems. Also it is annoying to clean.","Updated March 2022:<br /><br />After about a year and a half, I now have the same clicking issue many others have reported.  The left button either doesn't remain held or will double click on its own or will not register a click at all.  I want to say this started a few months ago, primarily with occasional double clicks and unregistered clicks and super rare hold drops, but I honestly chalked it up to user error.  But as of this week, it suddenly is very noticeably worse.  I can barely click and drag at all now and double clicks happen multiple times a day.  Very disappointing.  I am not sure if I even want another one considering people have apparently had this issue for a while.  Maybe they fixed it in newer versions?  I never had the right click issues other people had.  I have not used this mouse anywhere near as heavily as I have previous mice, most of which lasted 3-5 years each.  So 1.5 years is extremely disappointing.<br /><br />Additionally, the design of the mouse makes it some what annoying to clean.  Besides the crevices that are all over the place, especially around the buttons, the sides also have textured rubbery grips.  Dirt and grime and accumulate within the textured triangles and can be very annoying to clean unless you are wiping it down daily.

Weights are easy enough to add with a magnetic closure plate to make it sleek.<br />Myonly complaint would be for the DPI. The two buttons next to the left mouse click, are reserved for on the fly DPI adjustment. You can either use them for that or disable them, they are not programmable. Why? Yes on the fly DPI adjustment is important for some, but why not make them programmable? And, why are they so big?. For DPI adjustments two smaller buttons would have been fine. Lastly, these buttons don't have a distinctive feel difference between the two or a separation that you can feel.

2.0,5/5 Mice came with a double click issue.,"The mouse is an awesome looking mouse that has a lot of customizability. I bought my first one back in Aug of 2019 and it was great... for about 6 months. That's when I noticed an issue with the way the mouse clicks and drags. First the left button would double click, then the right button wouldn't maintain a constant click. (i.e. when you hold it down.) So I filed my first support ticket. They sent me a replacement in about 3 weeks. I then bought one for my GF thinking that it was a one off issue. About 4 months of using the replacement I got another issue with both buttons AGAIN.  Ok I thought, another support ticket. They again sent me a replacement. My friend asks for a mouse recommendation and I tell him ""If you get my mouse 'it works when it works.'"" He goes out to buy it. I might be VERY unlucky, but it's gotten to the point where I have to say something about it. My 2nd Replacement Is again doing the double clicking. My GFs mouse is also double clicking, as well as my friends mouse. This mouse is a TEMPORARY mouse. It will not last more than 6 months without issues. If you can pick it up for about 20$ then it's worth it, but for the 60$ I originally paid for it.... No way...

Contacted Logitech and at first it was fine they told me within 72 hours we should be sending you a new one out.<br /><br />10 days later since that last email. Multi calls to product support, three emails to them and they have gone silent no update, nothing and its becoming harder to use the mouse.<br /><br />Also do not get me started in the ""Software"" needed to use this product you can flush it down the toilet. Every update I have had to uninstall software and reinstall and reprogram all the buttons to be able to use them. I would give this product a 0 out of 5 if I am able to.

I loved making it heavier if I needed, it felt good in my hand, I loved everything about this mouse. But in the last couple weeks it has begun doing the double clicking thing that plagues all Logitech mice.<br /><br />They have suggested workarounds/solutions online, but none of those tend to ever fix the issue. The only true fix is voiding the warranty and swapping the switches. Another friend of mine just had the same thing start to happen to theirs. I really wish I didn't have to replace this mouse, but the double-clicking makes doing anything right now on my computer a damn chore. I am replacing it with the Razer Naga X. Not recommending that mouse, but I am leaving Logitech in regards to peripherals.<br /><br />This mouse was great while it lasted. But I'm sorry, a mouse should last longer than a year and a half.

1.0,Starts double clicking almost all the time now.,"Bought this in February, had raving reviews on how good this mouse is. Tried it and it was great. I use this mouse to day trade stocks and day trading with 3 large screens needed a mouse that can move fast and precise. Several days ago, Logitech released an update for the mouse. During the update, it kept asking me to plug my mouse to the computer even though it's already plugged in and working fine. So after several failed attempts of updating it, I change the USB port from the back of the tower to now the front of the computer tower, and that got it updated. But that's not all folks.<br /><br />After updating, I noticed right away, that the mouse starts to double clicking when I want to just single click. For instance, when I'm moving my windows' window to separate screen, it keeps maximizing the window. When I'm trading stocks, it would buy in more shares than what I wanted to. When I am looking at charts, it zoomed in for no reason. When I'm drawing on my charts, it started adding more lines than what I'm intending it to. The list goes on and on. I have a back up mouse now in case of this types of emergency happening. However, being a high-end mouse, I expected this mouse to be better than that.<br /><br />Do I recommend this?

2.0,Cheap buttons / signal problems,"I bought this mouse after a previous Logitech gaming mouse's wheel broke. The previous mouse lasted me 5 years, which was way beyond what I could've asked. This one lasted 6 months.<br /><br />The good: the ergonomics are great and the mouse manages to fit my monster-sized hands. I love the tune-able weights. The laser is quality and what I expect from Logitech's gaming offerings. The wheel's free-spin mode is awesome.<br /><br />The bad: After 6 months, the mouse doesn't generate a steady ""click-and-hold"" signal anymore, and sometimes a single click generates several rapid clicks instead. I can work around the multi-click issue in OS settings, but there is nothing that can solve the spotty ""click-and-hold"" signal besides pressing the button down with a vice-like deathgrip, which surely worsens the underlying hardware problem. Now, I am rarely able to successfully click-and-drag something. Beyond frustrating for the asking price.<br /><br />The problem is intermittent, though - when I wrote to Logitech's support about it I could no longer reproduce the issue and my ticket was closed. I should mention that support wants fairly herculean effort on the part of the user to demonstrate to them that you have an issue, which felt insulting considering the sheer volume of Logi products I use and have recommended to friends and colleagues.<br /><br />Seems to me that the switches being used in Logitech's mice may now be cheaper than what I'm accustomed to.

The left-click either double-clicks or just acts as you depresses the button (you can notice this during drag-and-drops, when the click is released half-way). This is the last Logitech mouse I will spend the money on, and I have owned pretty much all generations of multi-button mice.<br /><br />While CS will most likely send me a replacement for the mouse, since it is in warranty, I find it to be too much of a hassle to have to keep RMAing them. This is a mouse that was purchased in Nov of 2019 and broke in Apr of 2020.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/28/20: The mousse that was shipped to me as a replacement (received on 5/15), started doing the exact same thing with releasing the held button on its own.

Overall I've just gotten really familiar and attached to it for no reason. For just every day use and playing my favorite games, this worked wonderful... for a while. Unfortunately, I have now experienced the constant click/double click issue. I bought this mouse back in September 2020, it's now June 2020. I first noticed the click issues, minor at first, around April. When I clicked and held, expecting to shoot in R6S, it would shoot one bullet, then pause, and maaaaybe continue intermittently. Usually I'd have to click again and by then it was too late, I was dead. At first I thought it might be how I was gripping and clicking on the mouse button. As time got on it has gotten worse and expanded to the right mouse key as well - I can no longer aim down my sight consistently, it either doesn't register, or puts me in only to take me immediately out, no matter how I click or grip the mouse. During the time I've had the mouse, I've been using it daily for several hours - so I'd consider it heavy usage. It served me well for a large majority of my time. To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or takes its sweet time and clicks however many times it wants while dragging. This creates a lot of issues with my gaming so I will be purchasing a different mouse to replace this one :(",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEGYXE57ZWVQTGMS2TCYU6YLYKRA,1624205869376,0,True

5.0,Great Mouse - even with it being wired,"So with all the hype, this mouse has been getting I was a little sceptical about buying it. So for anyone else who is trying to decide if they should get the wireless version of this mouse or just an entirely different one here is my quick breakdown:<br /><br />*little background: I have and have been using a Logitech MX 3 mouse and have really liked it. At first, I wasn't sure about it because I have small hands but it's really grown on me. So the takeaway should be that I am used to using an ergo mouse & have small hands so take that into account with my review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Wired means no charging is needed (I hate when I get the red blinking light of frustration)<br />- It has adjustable weights<br />- It's program for programming the buttons is very easy and simple to use<br />- The wire is a solid material, long and durable.<br />- Buttons all feel great and have a good click to it<br />- Cheaper than the new Bluetooth version<br />- Comfortable to use for long gaming sessions or even just doing everyday stuff<br />Pros for the tech geeks:<br />- Great latency<br />- Tracking accuracy is fantastic<br />- buttons great with little squeak or friction<br /><br />Cons:<br />- buttons are a little loud when clicking on things. So that late-night gaming session might piss off your roommate.<br />- The weights can be a little finicky to figure out and I still haven't found an orientation or weight amount I'm satisfied with.<br />- It's not Bluetooth...if that kind of thing is important.<br /><br />Overall:<br />So no, this mouse isn't Bluetooth which I will admit, originally stopped me from getting it.  However, now that I have used it for a while I am thrilled with my purchase. When it comes to mice and keyboards, Logitech is always a safe bet.<br />This mouse is reliable, great for gaming, and comfortable. I would suggest the wired version over the Bluetooth simply on the fact that you get more bang for your buck (plus you can't forget to charge it).<br />Hope this was helpful to someone :)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG432MC6MGABLJ777NSQOH2S453A,1669164645406,1,True

So the takeaway should be that I am used to using an ergo mouse & have small hands so take that into account with my review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Wired means no charging is needed (I hate when I get the red blinking light of frustration)<br />- It has adjustable weights<br />- It's program for programming the buttons is very easy and simple to use<br />- The wire is a solid material, long and durable.<br />- Buttons all feel great and have a good click to it<br />- Cheaper than the new Bluetooth version<br />- Comfortable to use for long gaming sessions or even just doing everyday stuff<br />Pros for the tech geeks:<br />- Great latency<br />- Tracking accuracy is fantastic<br />- buttons great with little squeak or friction<br /><br />Cons:<br />- buttons are a little loud when clicking on things. So that late-night gaming session might piss off your roommate.<br />- The weights can be a little finicky to figure out and I still haven't found an orientation or weight amount I'm satisfied with.<br />- It's not Bluetooth...if that kind of thing is important.<br /><br />Overall:<br />So no, this mouse isn't Bluetooth which I will admit, originally stopped me from getting it.  However, now that I have used it for a while I am thrilled with my purchase. When it comes to mice and keyboards, Logitech is always a safe bet.<br />This mouse is reliable, great for gaming, and comfortable. I would suggest the wired version over the Bluetooth simply on the fact that you get more bang for your buck (plus you can't forget to charge it).<br />Hope this was helpful to someone :)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG432MC6MGABLJ777NSQOH2S453A,1669164645406,1,True

2.0,Issues after extended use.,"I liked this mouse until it started doing this. In instances where extended holding of one of the mouse buttons ( drag or drag-and-drop operations ), the mouse will begin throwing out multiple click events. This is pretty upsetting when you're expecting to be able to drag a thing from a place and then suddenly your dude stops doing that because the game thinks you clicked the mouse again.<br /><br />Considering this is a GAMING mouse meant for GAMING, this should not be a thing that is happening after just over a year of use. It suggests poor workmanship or poor quality materials. Or both.<br /><br />The thing that is most upsetting is that this is not an uncommon issue. I've searched on Google and found many posts about this exact same thing.<br /><br />So if you do a lot stuff that requires you to hold down a mouse button, this is definitely not the product for you, unless you like replacing your mouse after a year. Maybe the warranty is still good and I can get a refund for a more robust mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGJSLBYXKJZGFCAYPV4JWXILQ5WQ,1594870548896,0,True

You'll find guides for how to open the mouse up and use a soldering gun to fix it, but I'd say don't even bother putting yourself in that situation.

Apparently this is a common issue, but at the price, I just couldn't find another mouse that could compete. At the price, it's reasonable, I just wish if it was such a common issue, for it to have been fixed already especially since it's one of their more popular gaming mouse.

5.0,"Will literally be my only mouse I use, forever.","The Logitech G502 in my opinion, is one of the best mice on the market you would ever get.<br /><br />Every button on the mouse is programmable, but there are 5 extras that you can use for DPI or macros. You have to download either Logitech Gaming Software, or Logitech G Hub to assign the macros to your mouse.<br /><br />The ergonomics of the mouse are really good. I can keep a really good grip on the mouse, and its textured rubber on the sides help with gripping. I have quite large hands, and it still works flawlessly for me. Only thing is, depending on the person it might take some getting use to when you first use the mouse, as your hand might feel placed odd. People typically categorize how you hold the mouse in three types, palm, claw or hybrid. I personally use a hybrid grip on my mouse, for most control.<br /><br />It has a really large range for DPI, but of course most gamers don’t use so high of a DPI speed, and it is only a marketing gimmick for your mouse to be that high.<br /><br />The mouse has on-board memory in case of no internet or if you need to play somewhere other than your house. It only saves your RGB profiles and your sensitivity/DPI profiles. This mouse cannot save macros onto the onboard memory.<br /><br />The RGB lighting of the mouse is lackluster, but that is fine by me. It has lightning for the Logitech logo itself, and the DPI lighting on the side. RGB for me is not a must, and is only a nice edition to have.<br /><br />Now the most important thing, the weight.<br /><br />This mouse weighs 125g, and comes with metal weights to make it heavier if wished. Personally, I keep it right at 125 grams in order to keep it down, but for me it actually doesn’t matter. Some people might steer clear of this mouse because of that, and if you like lighter mice, this one isn’t for you.<br />The weight actually comes in advantage for me, as the weight of the mouse balances the speed at which I move it.<br /><br />There is one issue that is common for the mouse, and that is the dreaded double-click issue that occurs with the G502. The switches for the buttons may begin to register two presses. You can actually use the software to fix the issues, but that takes the use of macros away from you.<br /><br />Overall this mouse is a godsend, and is what made me use Logitech for all of my peripherals.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH2XUG4ZWS5AREQZH5LP37BXU2SQ,1630326854105,0,True

I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers and the Logitech software. I tired it on different USB ports and different computers. Nothing fixed the issues.<br /><br />I was about to return the mouse and try a different product and manufacturer all together despite really liking the physical product. Then I found out that there are two different Logitech platforms that can be used to configure Logitech peripherals: GHub and Logitech Gaming Software. I had been using GHub initially. At the advice of a random internet stranger, I uninstalled GHub and installed the alternative Logitech Gaming Software (LGS). Mouse works great now. No issues whatsoever.<br /><br />The experience left me with pretty mixed feelings overall.<br /><br />I'd say the mouse would probably get a 4/5 star with the LGS software. The button placement of the back/forward could be a little further forward or adjustable, but I have slightly larger than average hands. For most this would probably be a non-issue.

Sadly I can't say the purchase experience has been all that great for me. While I still love the features this mouse provides it didn't even last a year. Within 6 yo 8 months it began experiencing a stutter on the right mouse button which spread to the left as well. Looking online it's a pretty widely known issue, which they even put out a firmware update to attempt to fix. When that didn't help I contacted customer support to potentially get a replacement, they were, to my surprise, absolutely no help. They instructed me to clean the mouse and provided a link to a webpage that would count ""rapid double clicks"" and requested that I get video footage testing the mouse. However the webpage doesn't pick any unusual behavior up, but the mouse displays the same behavior across multiple games. So long story short I'm stuck with a sort of reliable mouse.

1.0,The single least reliable mouse I have ever owned.,"*Update* I got a replacement mouse, and after about 5 months of use, it no longer registers left clicks consistently. This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market. I'm unable to play FPS at all anymore; I can hold my button down using an automatic weapon, and it will fire a SINGLE shot. This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy. I'm not going to bother trying to get a 3rd mouse. This is a garbage product.<br /><br />I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems.<br /><br />I enjoyed it while it worked, but it has slowly stopped doing that.<br /><br />Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly. It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down. Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year. So far its impeding my workflow and ability to game properly, and Logitech Support has been startlingly unhelpful (its still under warranty).<br /><br />None of the problems I'm facing are isolated or rare: google search results will tell you as much. Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations.<br /><br />I ordered a Corsair Scimitar Pro to replace this.

2.0,Random clicks make for a bad gaming experience,"The mouse was OK at first.  The five buttons were convenient, and the ability to customize its weight may appeal to some.  The backlighting is kind of cool.  However, it quickly built up a static charge that prevents the buttons from working properly.  When the buttons are held down, they randomly click every few seconds or so, which completely destroys the gameplay for which it was intended.  There is a workaround that involves unplugging the mouse and clicking furiously to discharge the static, but it's a very temporary solution that reduces the frequency of the clicks for a few hours before it's back to randomly clicking every few seconds when attempting to drag objects or move the camera.  Overall, I'm very disappointed with the mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHX6JKMBMJQ5CVWBY6M7GOR5W4DQ,1633762208710,0,True

5.0,Logitech G502 HERO Gaming Mouse Full Review,"This awesomely satisfying mouse has taken gaming up to its limits; it is comfortable, responsive, and not to mention, buttony! The G502 HERO features great traits and properties that are bound to be shared by whoever dares to operate it.<br /><br /> What kind of sensitivity does this mouse have? Logitech has surely done an outstanding job programming the DPI (Dots Per Inch) in this mouse. It can go up to 16000 DPI in just 0.46 seconds! And that’s not all. This mouse has been installed with the fastest frame rate processing yet! The HERO’s sensor is used in a next-generation type sensitivity that allows a maximum of 400 IPI (in-plane switching) across the 16000 DPI. In other words, it provides absolute zero smoothing, highest quality filtering, and increased acceleration! The 502 achieves competition level precision and the most consistent responsiveness ever! Now, on to the lightsync.<br /><br /> The lightsync on this mouse has over 16 million colors. It also has the best RGB that has ever been installed. In the G502, LIGHTSYNC is newly scripted so that it can be synced with a lightsync keyboard (a keyboard that can change colors). Logitech even programmed the lightsync to speed up slow responsive keyboards and computers! This mouse is the first one I ever had that has a built in lightsync. Wow, this LIGHTSYNC feature sure does have a ton of my attention, but does it get as much attention as the clicking of its 11 buttons?<br /><br /> Fundamentally, this mouse is pretty much famed for its clicking and buttons with its top-notch number of 11 programmable buttons. Plus, this mouse can be drag clicked, creating friction on the left and right click buttons to make the mouse click extraordinarily quick. And, it can also be  jitter-clicked, tensing up your wrist muscle to make the mouse click lighting fast. In fact, you can practically move, melee, and aim with just the mouse itself, which is quite clever because just think of all that money that can be saved when it is time to choose a keyboard for gaming! The real test came in playing Minecraft on the G502. It was like testing out a brand new game! These mouse buttons really put the power of moves at your fingertips (literally)! Wait, but what happened to scrolling?<br /><br /> This scroll wheel is overpowered. It has its regular up and down scrolling, and 2 more new kinks that logitech added to its G502! Everyone has been complaining about why they can’t scroll sideways with a scroll wheel. Well, logitech has brought that to life by making a scroll wheel that can scroll right and left! You just need to push the scroll wheel to the right or to the left and voila, you can scroll sideways now! The last amazing feature is that there is a slanted button right behind the scroll wheel. That button is what logitech calls “free scroll and lock scroll”. When you need to leaf through an extremely long article, just click the “free scroll and lock scroll” button and the scroll wheel spins freely making the article pass by in a flash! When you need to scroll with more precision, just click the “free scroll and lock scroll” button and your scroll wheel will spin only when you manually move it. This metallic scrolling wheel has surely delivered confident, smooth, and satisfying control for either mode. Now, I don’t have to drag to scroll sideways, the scroll wheel saves my energy! We have covered a lot of ground now, but we aren’t done yet! On with the weight!<br /><br /> I feel that this mouse is different from other gaming mice because the G502 literally has weights that you can put in underneath the mouse! You just pry open the bottom and there are empty slots in the bottom of the G502. This allows you to fine tune the weight of this mouse and glide to your advantage! Five 3.6g weights come with the G502 HERO and are configurable in a variety of ways such as: front, back, left, right, or everywhere! Also, the weights are magnetic so that they will pop into their slots on the mouse with ease. Experiment with your very own unique alignment and balance to find that sweet spot you were looking for to optimize your gaming performance.<br /><br /> Lastly, having a wired mouse is more reliable than a wireless mouse. The wired mice have higher sensitivity than wireless ones, and wired mice don’t need batteries while wireless mice do. You can rely more on wired mice because they will never stop in mid function. Likely the HERO G502 would be more expensive if it was wireless. Therefore, for all these reasons, I choose a wired mouse over a wireless mouse any day. The HERO G502 is wired, but the pluses of wired far outweigh the convenience of not having a wire attached to it.<br /><br />In my Point of view, I really suggest getting this one-of-a-kind gaming mouse. It has great sensitivity, a colorful lightsync feature, 11 programmable and smooth buttons, unique metallic scroll wheel, and a specially designed weight system for your specific gaming experience! This mouse is the best and only gaming mouse that I have right now and if you want to get one for yourself, please go right ahead. This mouse may be expensive, but it is totally worth the money. Logitech has really hit the spot with this unique design and its features!<br /><br />(This review is originally written by an 11 year old and posted by his parents for others to get the full view of the awesomeness of this mouse.)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFEVJINWVPOB52NRLA4LCVZQ2ZJQ,1611718420986,0,False

I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward.  I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars.<br /><br />Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT!  Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you.  I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it!  Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now.  Fix your products Logitech!<br /><br />I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue.<br /><br />RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches.

2.0,Double-clicking after a few months. Terrible purchase.,"I purchased this mouse in the beginning of 2020 and in May, it is starting to double-click. The issue has become so bad that it is sometimes impossible for me to highlight text, drag icons around on my desktop, or play a character like Hanzo in Overwatch. I wish I had done more research before purchasing any type of mouse from Logitech, but the issue stems from the switches they use. These fail relatively quickly because of how cheap they are, coming from China. Many other people around the internet have had the same issues so most likely, you're going to need to RMA the mouse every four months, learn how to fix the switches yourself, or just buy a computer mouse from another company. I had used a Corsair M65 without any actual trouble for over two years prior to deciding to try something new and will be trashing this one to go back to Corsair. I have been PC gaming for over twenty years now and have never found myself as frustrated with a mouse since using the G502 HERO. Logitech will tell you that it could be the USB port or that the mouse just needs its drivers updated but this simply isn't true. If a mouse is double clicking, it's likely hardware within the device that is failing or broken.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG2ETJQAGBHJ7YCHJT2LLZM6J5LA,1590978857224,0,True

5.0,"Best gaming mouse you'll ever own, minus the inevitable double click problem! But it's fixable!","This is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned.  I love the software, buttons, and all the cool stuff you can do.  The top feature for me in particular is the scroll wheel, which with the press of a button lets you scroll freely instead of having it click in steps.  I can't go to any other mouse now since to my knowledge none have that feature, and makes me wonder why other brands haven't universally adopted the feature.<br /><br />It is essentially, the perfect mouse except as others have mentioned, you are likely to start having problems with the left and right click 'double clicking' on press.  After hours of searching, I found a fix in a random youtube comment without having to pull the mouse apart by blowing out the left and right buttons, holding them down for 10s, shaking, twisting a bit, then holding down again and shaking some more somewhat carefully without being too rough.  It seems there must be some dust or grime that gets caught in the clicking mechanisms over time.  After that it was fixed and I didn't have problems again, but if I do I'll try it again.<br /><br />Certainly not a perfect fix and why I knocked off 2 stars on quality of material, but its better than having to switch to a different and inferior mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFZEUNSETCQDGQ4EIXXPBZXBL5HQ,1642123021396,0,True
3.0,Great Mouse...Button Issue,"UPDATE 4/21/20: Just received a warranty replacement for the mouse. Increased my rating to 3 stars. Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use.<br /><br />I purchased the mouse in May 2019. Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny. The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working. Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again. This would have the effect of dragging a different item than I originally selected.<br /><br />Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work. Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible.<br /><br />Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users.<br /><br />I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet. I will update this review once/if I do. Otherwise, I would warn others to avoid a mouse that stops working correctly after only a few months.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF5VAOA3ANZTMMGQVZTFXO4KMECQ,1586312097327,8,True

2.0,"Onboard ""memory"" unlikely.","This is a very ergonomic mouse, fits in the hand, is pretty accurate and has the easy to set up weights. This is not a bad mouse. but it is either handicapped or misadvertised by Logitech. I don't have too much to say about the mouse other than the few issues that really prevent me from liking it completely over my much cheaper, and older Perixx mouse.<br /><br />The side buttons on top are okay. I have small hands and I still occasionally hit the top two. This would not be an issue if it wasn't automatically set to WEBPAGE BACK, and WEBPAGE FORWARD macros. So when you're browsing and you bump your mouse you will likely mess up whatever webpage you were on or whatever youtube video you were on.<br /><br />I would love to change this and looked into it; this is where I discovered the other issue. You have two options to control this mouse, OMM and Ghub. OMM is an EXE that is supposed to be able to control the memory on board and change macros for the G502 hero. In reality, you REQUIRE to have Ghub installed and also ALWAYS RUNNING as a program and as a service for OMM to actually do anything for the G502; otherwise, it will complain that it can't actually detect or do anything to the mouse.<br /><br />If you run Ghub (which is nothing but complaints online) and actually change the macros with OMM; they DO apply to the mouse. But as soon as you exit Ghub - the mouse macros you just set 5 seconds ago will work for about 10, then reset to the default out of the box problematic macro assignments.<br /><br />This is where I have a big problem, this mouse advertises on board memory but does not remember any macro settings through Ghub or OMM which relies on Ghub. This is not how ON BOARD MEMORY works, key word here being MEMORY. It will not memorize your macro settings. This 100% reliance on objectionably garbage software is why I have to give this otherwise good mouse, 2 stars. and that is being generous.<br /><br />I have a cheaper and much older mouse that you can set the macros on with the software, then literally uninstall the software, and those macro/hotkey assignments you set on that mouse will persist until you change them again. This is how on board memory should be treated and managed.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFKQ32YYPI7C4OKQOSQOUQVAKHDQ,1673035938667,1,True

Now this game has made some fps (right-click to zoom) or wow(right-click to turn camera) literally unplayable after only 4 months of use.<br /><br />By the time this issue has occurred to me, I have also done a little research, apparently, this is a very common issue with the G502 model. I didn't find this issue affect MOBA too much, it still clicks, but anything requires you holding down the right-click button this would not be the ideal choice.<br /><br />*Update: It's pretty easy to get support from their website, and they will send you another one shortly after its approved. But this issue seems like a design flaw because the new one is starting to broke down as well.

Another problem I experienced occurred with on-the-fly DPI switching; DPI would increase just fine, however the return to lower, more controllable DPI settings had to be reset outside the application.<br /><br />I received my first 502 Hero as a gift. last Christmas (2019)  I purchased a replacement (this order) which arrived DOA, no lights, no action.<br /><br />I have been using Logitech products for close to 22 years.

The sensitivity controls are in the weirdest spots. They're two buttons (that I didn't even know were buttons) right next to the left mouse button, that feel WEIRD to push. I appreciate the options for profiles, and sensitivity control: they should've switched the locations, and either placed those buttons next to the left click in a better spot (Cough! Middle button), or make it feel like a button, and not accent.<br /><br />Now let's get to the other middle button. A lot of Logitech mice have the option to switch from flywheel scrolling to staggered. The staggered mode (which usually switches it to 3 line skip) is unusable.

5.0,Great mouse for CAD.,"I'm a CAD modeler, as well as a gamer. This mouse is the best mouse I've ever used for a few reasons.<br /><br />The first is the fact that you can unlock the scroll wheel with the click of a button. I simply refuse to buy any other mouse that does not have this feature now. I love being able to zoom in close to a fine detail in my model, and when i'm done, unlocking the zoom wheel and quickly zooming back out. It's also great for scrolling through websites, or long multi paged PDFs. In short, it's a cool feature that has improved my workflow.<br /><br />Second reason is how it feels. This is a preference thing; but, it's much heavier than most other mice that I've used, and you can adjust that by adding or removing the little weights that it comes with. Personally I use all the weights, and enjoy how substantial it feels in my hand. Other mice just kind of feel cheapy now.<br /><br />It's more than serviceable for gaming. It's got a button where your thumb is that lowers your mouse sensitivity for when you're trying to line up a long range shot. The mouse is comfortable, responsive, and has just the right amount of programmable buttons for me.<br /><br />The price makes it a no brainer, and I will buy it again when the time comes.

I liked the idea of extra buttons on the G502 and they seem all reachable. Also seems to be mechanical improvement to DPI setting buttons, which you can reprogram per game if you want.

2.0,Disappointed. Will no longer purchase Logitech Mice.,"I had an iBuyPower mouse that lasted me six years I got for $11 at a thrift store. This g502 Logitech Hero hasn't even lasted me two years. I was waiting to review this for this purpose. I'm now back to using the thrift store mouse because the g502 Hero is no longer functioning.<br /><br />The upside: The mouse feels nice and glides effortlessly across most surfaces. It is comfortable.<br /><br />Primary Issues: Comfort is about all this piece of junk has going for it. Left click doesn't double click all the time, and actually stopped ""clicking"" a few months into use so now I just have to guess since there is no audible click or touch-sensory click. The right click doesn't work at all most of the time and that's important for some games and functions I use on my computer, so I have to use my other mouse entirely for that purpose.<br /><br />Glider Wheel broke several months in. I was able to fix it by cleaning it out the first time, thinking it was just general build up or something, but the second time the button which allows you to utilize the smooth wheel versus the click wheel went out, and any time I try to up-scroll it doesn't register as a scroll and instead registers as me clicking the wheel.<br /><br />Again, the right click stopped working. It still clicks, I can feel it, I can hear it, but the mouse doesn't react. I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled and still nothing.<br /><br />Unreliable DPI stability feature. Sometimes my DPI will drop well below acceptable usability, then recover on its own.<br /><br />The entire software setup, this gHub or whatever, is absolute garbage. Completely. Ridiculous. Trash. It is a convoluted mess requiring so much more work than is necessary to use. It crashes for no reason despite updates, does not save profiles, does not let you utilize macros, is not user friendly, and requires manual startup. If you click to open it, it just sits on the ""Update"" screen indefinitely.<br /><br />There are too many other things I want to say about this product, but overall, and being a lifelong fan of Logitech, I'm more than disappointed. This is the second g502 Hero I've bought (the one I bought from Amazon was New/Unused) and to be quite honest I'd rather go through another company than deal with these issues anymore.  I won't be using their ""gaming"" mice ever again.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFSNJX3GKA3UACIY6LLGASYBL2KQ,1613696119094,0,True

That said, I purchased the protection plan since everything I have heard about this mouse lead me to believe that it will fail within a few years.<br /><br />Design flaws/QC defects aside, I really like this mouse so far. It has a bunch of features not present on other mice, like the infinite scroll wheel, left and right scroll buttons on the scroll wheel, programmable profiles, and the button to temporarily change between DPI settings within a profile when held. I'm not terribly keen on the shape of the mouse, but I'm getting used to it.<br /><br />I don't like the nylon braiding on the wire. I liked the cloth braided wires on older mice better. Yes, they were prone to kinking over time, but that's just my personal preference in the end.<br /><br />The customization software is fairly simple, but some features are easier to adjust than others.

Great ergonomics, great sensor...  If it could last a couple of years then maybe it'd be worth $50, but...  This is just straight up unacceptable out of a company as big as Logitech, and a switch that they say will last for 50 million clicks.  Granted... it still clicks.

The bad: the mouse buttons take almost no effort to click - maybe half the effort compared to G602, so I end up clicking both buttons instead of one pretty often.  Also, although I like being able to switch between the clicky and smooth motion of the wheel, the clicky mode is too loud, much louder than G602.

After waiting an hour for something to happen, a quick Google search revealed that to do the upgrade YOU NEED TO UNPLUG THE MOUSE AND PLUG IT BACK IN.<br /><br />Imagine writing a piece of software that says specifically not to do the one thing that fixes it.

Sometimes the buttons wont work as assigned and you have to go back and forth setting it, seeing if it works in game and then back to the button assignments.

5.0,Incredible Gaming Mouse; Works for Macbook,"I’ve been looking for a nice gaming mouse, and if you are too, you can click Add to Cart. The Logitech G502 Hero works absolute wonders. For starters, the weight customization is amazing. You can change how heavy the mouse is to fit your own needs, and it comes with plenty of extra weights. It has bright LED’s on the mouse, which can be customized for different colours and effects. There are 3 buttons on the left side of the mouse, for the thumb; 2 buttons next to the LMB; and one button in the middle (besides the scroll lock). It has a nice clicking sound and it’s easy to click fast on it. It connects to the computer via a braided usb cable. It also has a very nice scroll wheel, and overall it feels very sturdy and well-made.<br /><br />Now about the software. Logitech GHub is a simple install for this, and it is very user friendly. You can make macros, shortcuts, change lighting, and remap buttons on the mouse with ease. You can also sync the lighting to your Logitech Keyboard. I have had no issues with it thus far, and it is likely my favourite accessory to my computer.<br /><br />Now compatibility. I am using a 2019 Macbook Pro, and the mouse works with all features. It does not lose any features compared to Windows, which occurs with many mice.<br /><br />TL;DR<br /><br />-Pros<br />•Well-made<br />•Weight customization<br />•Easy and fast clicking<br />•Remappable Buttons<br />•LED Customization<br />•Fantastic software<br />•Perfect compatibility with Macbooks<br /><br />-Cons<br />•I can’t give it a six star rating",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEOMM5HVCZUZ3UATLEDT5VDCOF7A,1583507108795,1,True

5.0,I have a working scroll wheel again.,"(BACKSTORY)<br />I actually owned this mouse before, the only difference is that I purchased it from a different vendor (Gamestop) and during the same day I was already having an issue with my right click button being ""sticky"", and after some time I had issues with the left switch staying pressed and was even causing double-click issues.<br /><br />I attempted to fix this problem by ordering some new switches as a replacement, unfortunately de-soldering the switches themselves proved to be a very time-consuming since no matter how much solder I was able to remove using both the solder pen and the solder wick, the old switches would just not let go.<br /><br />After using some (unfortunate) force I was able to pry the left switch out, but I was worried I had to go through a brutish process just to do so before I was able to finally solder the new switch in place.<br />Upon putting everything back together I was however already met with some bad news, not only did the LED for the product logo stop function, but so did my scroll wheel, I attempted to fix the latter issue myself but have achieved no success, but at the very least the new button was working fine until I was able to get a new copy shipped in (7/31/2021).<br />(END OF BACKSTORY)<br /><br />As of this review date's submission I have not be getting any issues with the mouse, and while the Logitech app reads it to be the model with a 25k sensor it's odd that the (abused) box it came in (with no packaging either besides the box itself) advertises it as the 16k model.<br /><br />But overall, and for the time being, the mouse is working great and I even applied some rubber anti-sweat adhesive layers over it which helps me protect the aesthetic quality of the mouse, and even though I thoroughly wash my hands before settling myself back to my computer I still prefer the mouse with the rubber covers concealing the plastic matte finish.<br /><br />Now to run my favorite source games and bind some certain commands to my scroll wheel.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHNT7T5YOGDCHXKV56URQSX4UICQ,1627758145531,2,True

(not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)<br /><br />I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on.<br />You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied.<br />What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments?<br />It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly.<br /><br />Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB.<br />Honestly I wish I could just get my money back.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGCHEPDGILUDBXKKECBNMZYEQAJQ,1586286604591,0,True

Was given it as a gift. First year was great. Everything expected, around the end of the second year the mousewheel started wearing down and changing color.<br /><br />I know what you (the reader) are thinking ""I bet they are just a gross person who eats and drinks at their desk and doesn't clean up and gets their mouse and keyboard dirty/greasy"" I promise you this, I never eat or drink at my PC. Back to the review though.<br /><br />Around 2 years in - Mousewheel starts changing color - I slightly notice ""Oh huh, that's weird it has a texture/color to it I didn't notice before, whatever."" It wasn't until a coworker (year 3) using the same mouse that I notice ""Oh hey my scroll wheel is 100% not this nice silver, its red/brown/orange"", I start looking it up online and I see its a fairly common problem. I get around to filing a support ticket with the manufacture, let them know, they ask for serial number to get the info and boom ""Well its out of warranty sorry, here is a discount code if you want to buy a replacement"". No thanks, avoiding the brand in the future.<br /><br />I've owned mice until they stopped clicking after solid use for 5-6 years. Gaming mice can last this long. Don't get sucked into their cycle.

I purchased this mouse in March and the left click broke in July... a gaming mouse that has lasted me around five months, for a few hours a day. There is no external damage to the mouse, nor has it ever been dropped. The same day the left click broke the rgb decided to go out. When I plugged it into a different port the port then shorted and broke the usb3 ports on the front of my computer. There’s a reason it’s on sale all the time.

3.0,"A nice cheap gaming mouse, but just wasn't for me.","I purchased this mouse for my first PC build because I wanted something with extra programmable buttons, but not a crazy amount of extra buttons like on an MMO mouse. While it seemed ideal at first, I just could not get used to how the buttons were oriented on this mouse. Everything seemed tough for me to find in the moment, and I really wasn't a huge fan of the ""gamer"" design. Instead, I went for the G604 Lightspeed mouse, which offers the extra buttons on the side of the mouse, but in a more straightforward row/grid design. After a few weeks using the G604 in comparison to this G502, I'm definitely glad I made the switch.<br /><br />I think this mouse is a great cheap option for a decent quality mouse from Logitech, but I do think there's better out there for a little more money.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF7FAUEP3URNOF5GSOLCSARCMKTQ,1657051817569,0,True

Too many buttons are designed near the thumb and I did accidentally push these buttons when playing the game. The worst design in my mind is its antislip surface on two sides.

2.0,Good for short-term use and for large hands (double click issue after 7 months),"I have used this mouse for about 7 months almost every day for work purposes and/or gaming before it broke down. Just like a lot of people have mentioned, it will ultimately result in double click issues (very common). This is when you click left or right button and it registers more than once. For example, I may want to highlight something, but while I am holding down the left button, it will register a click again, making it lose the highlight before and highlighting a new one from that instance. In addition, this mouse is more suitable for those who do a full grip and have larger hands. It is slightly heavier than a normal mouse.<br /><br />Regardless, this mouse is great in features such as weight adjustment with several mouse buttons. Something to note is that even with all the weights adjustment off, it is still heavier than some of the smaller logitech mouse. It is a great mouse, only if you want to buy a new one every year or so. It does have a two year warranty, so I am waiting on that.

4.0,Buyer beware - Will require service for button switch issue.

4.0,"Overrated, but still good","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.<br /><br />Weight and Size<br />The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available.  However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it.  In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse.  This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features.  The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all.  The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.<br /><br />I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters.  Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.<br /><br />With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better.  I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet<br /><br />The cable is built like a tank.  No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.<br /><br />The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.<br /><br />The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.<br /><br />Mouse clicks are very light and responsive<br /><br />The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine<br /><br />Thumbrest is supportive<br /><br />The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking<br /><br />You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.<br /><br />When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)<br /><br />The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh<br /><br />When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle<br /><br />The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust<br /><br />While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy.  It also gets in the way sometimes.<br /><br />DPI button could be shifted back little<br /><br />The optional weights are almost completely useless<br /><br />Performance<br />The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.<br /><br />The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.<br /><br />The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions.  The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons.  The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.<br /><br />However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse).  I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse.  This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.<br /><br />Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons.  I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.<br /><br />FINAL VERDiCT<br />Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it.  For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse.  Your experience will be much better.  But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out.  Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGMD2BWGYSZDPGDPZGMLES7HUGUQ,1596899689055,0,True

5.0,Awesome mouse,"So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.<br /><br />First is the design:<br /><br />The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.<br /><br />Second is the software:<br /><br />The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.<br /><br />Third is the delivery:<br /><br />It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.<br /><br />If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZrzU85sL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZrzU85sL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RZrzU85sL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AE6YAF7O7IVHPH3J6S6U2NR6SIGA,1614803903573,0,True

1.0,Don’t rely on customer support if it breaks within the warranty period.,"The mouse worked fine for approximately one month before it suddenly stopped functioning.

I was asked to send a photo of the serial number and mouse, etc. to them.  Several days passed and I was sent a response from a different customer support person basically telling me to repeat the steps and again send in the photos.  One week later, same thing, different person.  Back and forth emails were getting nowhere.<br />Finally, another person said that the warranty replacement was being processed and I would hear back from them within 72 hours.

Except the setting is from a much older version so can't do that either. It's been 2 weeks and I already hate this thing.

There are 2 buttons right next to the left mouse button, the most used button on a mouse, the 2 buttons adjust the dpi (sensitivity) of the mouse. Because they are literally right next to the left mouse button, it is super easy to accidentally press on it. I had to remove all other profiles from G Hub (Logitech Software), so that the 2 buttons are virtually disabled. Or I guess you can also functionally disable them in G Hub. Anyway, the rest of the mouse's design are alright, just takes some getting used to if you came from a Razer, whose mouses tend to be quite simplistic (except Naga).",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEPCL4DDXJNMV26ENUDUKZTKEJJQ,1624502051825,0,True

3.0,"Great Mouse, except for that Pesky ""Double Clicking"" issue","I've used Logitech Mice for several years now. I lost my old Logitech Mouse in my move to another state and I needed a replacement I bought the wireless lightspeed mouse. It started having double clicking issues, and I ended up chucking it. I decided to go with the standard wired mouse, and I saw the Logitech G502 Gaming mouse with the hero sensor. It was cheap so I bought it. All I will say is thank goodness it was cheap.<br /><br />What I love about the mouse is the number of buttons you have and how it feels. I like heavy mice and it comes with adjustable weights. I also like how I'm able to customize the mouse to how I play my games with the software. Note: I'm using the older Logitech software, not the newer crap they're using now. I feel it's just more user-friendly. I also like the ""Free"" mouse scrolling wheel. Overall the mouse looks and feels good, and the price was wallet-friendly.<br /><br />NOW, we get to the major issue. Both this mouse and the light-speed wireless one I have before it ended up having double-clicking issues. I've tried cleaning it, adjusting my mouse double-clicking speed, but to no avail. I'm so tired of Logitech and how cheap their mice are built. It's a crying shame too because I think the mouse is great for gaming, but that stupid double click issue is not being resolved. This will probably be the last Logitech Gaming mouse I buy until they do a better job with making them and fixing the double-clicking issue.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF4SSXGXKM2ZMGO53ABJFG2BM2FQ,1628604948361,0,True

Then it got worse: now they don't work at all, and I have to cycle through the profiles on the mouse just to get any buttons to work at all (I think because the computer thinks the forward/back buttons are just being pressed all the time, so it doesn't even register the normal left/right buttons).

1.0,"Terrible, unless you get lucky. Double click issue.","I was extremely happy with this mouse for the first couple of months that I had it, until I began noticing an issue with the primary mouse button registering single clicks as two near-instantaneous clicks. For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue. For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage... Guess what. Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death. This isn't an uncommon issue either, and logitech is very well; however, their upper management has put policies in place to make it unreasonably prohibitive to acquire a replacement mouse. By the time I was done sending in all of the screenshots of click-register testing, pictures of the mouse and serial numbers, I gave up because I had other things going on in my life to the point where I'd probably pay $40 just to tell Logitech to shove the mouse up a place where no light can be shone.<br /><br />From what the Logitech rep told me, the switch issue that is present (and has been present for 1-2+ years) is prevalent in many mouse manufacturers. Strange how they haven't implemented a fix yet, though...

3.0,Not the best,"First off, just going to vent about QC:<br />First mouse I got the lights stopped working after about a month. Second mouse had two issues, the right click button sometimes double clicks so if I am scoping in playing any FPS game, it will scope out or jitter. Super annoying. The second issue is the pad on the bottom of the mouse kept getting caught  on my mouse pad. Must have been poorly placed or something. Like a tiny piece of the plastic sticks outwards and scratches the mouse pad.<br /><br />Using the mouse:<br />I want to preface this by saying I use palm grip. If you use claw grip you might have different (better) results. Anyway the ergonomics are actually trash. Some of the ""extra"" buttons are too easy to accidentally press. This happens from time to time when you are playing games and your arm gets stiff and you adjust your grip. Boom accidentally touched like 4 buttons. The biggest offenders are the left and right mouse-3 inputs (where you tilt the mouse wheel in one direction) and the 3rd mouse button on the side. The 2 extra buttons on the left mouse button are just too out of reach of the index finger. Definitely have better experience using those buttons with claw grip.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Unfortunately at this price point you won't find much else that is better. The only other ones are just random Chinese products that have low quality sensors, even if they look flashy. Hence my 3-star review.

2.0,"Proteus was better, Hero is plagued with stuttering. Logitech removed key software features.","I used a Proteus version for a decade. It was an amazing mouse, never had issues.<br />Had to get a new one and only Hero was available. Figured a newer version would be better. Wrong.<br /><br />Lots of people are plagued by weird ""stuttering"" on this mouse. You can google it and find dozens on dozens of reports of it, with virtually no solutions. Just people guessing and trying random things. Lots of placebo and then they come back and report the issue came back.<br /><br />I've tried all these steps and more:<br />-Reinstalling logitech<br /><br />-uninstalling any and all mouse drivers<br /><br />-disabling any RGB controlling software like Gigabyte RGB Fusion someone claimed messed with it<br /><br />-disable ""allow games to control RGB""<br /><br />-Reducing mouse polling rates<br /><br />-Different USB ports<br /><br />-Disabling USB power suspension in Windows 10<br /><br />-Cleaning the sensor<br /><br />-Cleaning the mouse pad<br /><br />-Changing the mouse pad.<br /><br />I previously had an acrylic mouse pad. Hard surface. Logitech G Hub used to have a ""tuning"" option where you could tinker with settings and calibrate the mouse to that mouse pad. Worked great with Proteus.<br />Hero doesn't have that and/or Logitech removed the tuning option entirely. So this option which possibly would fix the issue is no longer available.<br /><br />I bought 2 new mouse pads that I didn't want - soft fabric type and one that is a bit thicker fabric like a traditional mouse pad. At first I thought maybe it improved but I still get the issue. The mouse will stutter especially if I try to move fast to click something precise, or highlight text.

1.0,Common issues with Right Mouse Button for Logitech G502,"Bought the mouse back in May 2019, noticed issues with the right mouse button within 3 months. Potentially a firmware issue, could be hardware, but regardless its common in this mouse and will come up with a quick google search. Most noticeable is that the right mouse button will bounce when pressed. This will manifest in either the mouse double clicking with a single press, or not being able to maintain a held press without registering additional clicks.<br /><br />For gaming, this makes the mouse completely unreliable - You will not be able to confidently ADS in fps games, and you will not be able to pan your screen in games with right click drag.  The quality of the mouse switches do not live up to the rest of the mouse - every other feature has been great,but at the end of the day I need a mouse that can right click.<br /><br />I would not recommend this mouse to anyone, and would point instead to the Razer Basilisk, which was built to profit off the success of this mouse ironically, but has access to optical sensors and Razer build quality.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHTI2CBRNKKLR24WVV5T46UOJJAQ,1599095810213,1,True
2.0,This is an OKAY mouse,"Editing my original review as I wrote it after having this mouse for only two weeks. I've had it for a little over a month now and yesterday I began to notice the double clicking that everyone is talking about. It was very subtle at first but this morning it was bad enough that it was affecting my gameplay. As someone who primarily plays FPS games, this is a huge problem. Although it's probably a huge problem no matter what type of games you play. This mouse was on sale when I bought it so I wanted to give it a shot. I'm not one to rage, slam, or be rough with my mice in any way while gaming so I thought I might get lucky and it'll last me at least a couple of months. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this product, unfortunately for me it only lasted a month. I went over to my local computer shop to see if they had any recommendations, and I also told one of the staff about the issue I ran into with this mouse. They informed me that most logitech mice are known to have double clicking issues. I'd just save your money and stay away from this brand overall. They recommended some razer products to me, as well as the Glorious PC Gaming Race Model O mouse.

This mouse is insanely ergonomic and feels like it was made for my hand. The removable weights are very nice, too (I prefer all of them to be in). It has a very satisfying click and the wheel can either be smooth or lightly clicky. You can also adjust your pointer speed directly on the mouse, which I adore! The cord is long and has a fabric covering. There's a wireless version, but those irritate me. It also moves very smoothly on the mousepad and works great with super fast pointer speed.

The problem is that after some time lmb starts to lose its ability to detect touch, clicking and dragging stopped working, it would unclick itself and then re click itself as I held down. This also sometimes led to double clicks if I clicked something and held my finger down between .5-1sec. This... makes it entirely un-useable as a gaming mouse and anything more than web surfing, cannot drag files anymore or anything. Talked to one of my friends and they had a similar issue.

Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun. From what I've gathered, it's a well known hardware issue that pertains to the switches. The problem is clicking, holding and dragging. The click releases and then clicks again while dragging. There's been posts of customer's having this problem right out of the box. The only way to resolve it is by ordering different switches, voiding your warranty, and attempting to replace them yourself.<br /><br />The mouse feels good and the option to add weight is nice but not necessary. I like the RGB and extra buttons but the mouse wheel feels a bit derpy. I did end up getting used to that though. What you can't get used to is the broken primary and secondary buttons releasing while click holding. Someone on Reddit mentioned a macro fix and it has helped many but it has not helped me. This is a hardware issue. I thought maybe it was firmware but no... I have updated and still not working properly. I'm very upset with this and I will be contacting their customer support for a replacement.

Number of buttons is a happy medium and there's a nifty little physical scroll wheel lock button that I really like. My only real gripe is with the DPI/sensitivity; the presets are great, but somehow my sensitivity keeps changing all over the place. My hunch is that my hands are a little too big and I keep somehow tapping one of the 3 DPI changing buttons.

It has such a cheap smooth plastic texture that causes my finger to slide across it when I use it. I use the mouse wheel to switch weapons in games so this has become extremely annoying.

It's a fairly fresh OS install without any other Logitech software.  I have tried re-installing several times without any success.  LGS installed and ran just fine however.

Their RMA process is painful and without much feedback, and honestly if they'd just use higher quality switches I might consider them. At this point though, I will continue to love the mouse and use it daily, but knowing in the back of my mind it will likely fail again (these reports are common!) and I'll never go back to Logitech again.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHULDHX7SEVP4BJDI7NJOKIVIGTA,1593624360278,0,False

1.0,"great product, but comes with huge problem","purchased 3/14/2020.  start noticing left click/drag tends to double click after about 2 months use. today is 6/4/2020, problem is more persistent, pretty much will not drag/click hold on left mouse click.  running latest driver, using Logitech G Hub with profile, mouse cleaned so no dust/derbies inside.<br /><br />Decided to google this problem and did what i could based on all reddit/forum advises and nothing helps.  But one thing is consistent, this problem is a common issue with this mouse and support is minimal from logitech, i have a ticket put in now through their site as they note a ""2-year limited hardware warranty"" for this product as of 6/3/2020.  According to some people this issue is due to a ""switch"" that needs to be replaced/soldered, but if you do this you will void all warranty.<br /><br />Just google the problem yourself and decide if this is the right mouse for you.  I really should've stuck w the razer deathadder instead of trying this out.<br /><br />****UPDATE 2/15/2021:<br />currently on my FOURTH replacement from Logitech.  left click failed on all 3 after about 3-4 month of normal usage, no heavy gaming done.  essentially, if you click and hold on a double click site that logitech provides for mouse tests for when you report a mouse issue to them, the click counter will keep rising.  Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage.  while my friend recommended this mouse to me and has not had an issue, I'm currently on my FOURTH logitech hero as of yesterday.  replacement takes 3-4 weeks time and it is tedious.

There are plenty of great in-depth reviews on Amazon and on YouTube and various other forums on why this mouse is so good, so I won't waste any further time aside from providing this brief input.<br /><br />The only concern I have with this mouse is the wrapping of the cable. After a bit of usage, the sleeving on top of the plastic cable somehow gets lose and undos itself to where it causes tension in a part of the cable. This is only a cosmetic concern, it will not effect the mouse nor present any issues. This is because the wires of the cable are protected by a plastic covering and atop the plastic covering is the sleeving. I've had two wired G502s over the years, and this issue has happened on both mices so be aware.<br /><br />Aside from that, no other complaints.

1.0,NOT for Macbook Pro. User interface is crap,"I have a G502 on my PC, which I use for work. I need different shortcuts on different software and so the G502 works perfectly and the user interface (which has been updated, but I haven’t replaced there) is easy to use.<br /><br />I got the Hero thinking it would be great to have the same functionality on my Mac which I’m using more now for work since I’m often on the go. Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Let’s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn’t recognize the mouse. Fine, restarted and it still wouldn’t, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted before connecting: now it finally did. Great, except figuring out how to program the buttons was a pain largely because it was bugging out hard and things wouldn’t show, I only found out after I had to turn my laptop off to go somewhere else and turning it on again.<br /><br />Finally, after wasting my lunch and half an afternoon trying to figure it out, I managed to set it up. Great! Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa.<br /><br />“Ok, I’ll fix that on settings” there was no option on settings, so I fixed that on Apple configuration. Fixed! Work time! Except when I had to use the trackpad I came to find out now it was invented! Cue more time wasted on a solution I could not find.<br /><br />Finally I gave up, willing to suck it up and enjoy my shortcuts that change from program to program, that would be dreamy, at least. Except it wasn’t, because no sooner had I started enjoying them when they stopped working for no reason.<br /><br />So it’s back to troubleshooting. More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again.<br /><br />I really wanted this to work so I asked for a replacement.

5.0,This is easily a 10/10 mouse,"I want to start by saying this was bought as a replacement for my other (2018) G502 that I myself broke while cursing the developers of a certain franchise. First and foremost, this mouse is incredibly well constructed.. I mean, to take a beating like it did and STILL function was something a Corsair/Razer mouse could never dream of achieving (I would know). Second, lets bring some attention to the mouse wheel. For me, it's always the first thing to go on a mouse, this one was the exception. Even after the beat down it STILL functioned flawlessly and I cannot believe it. Also, a free spinning mouse wheel with a mechanical toggle switch was for sure something I didn't realize I needed in my life at the time. Third, this mouse is incredibly budget friendly, especially when it's on sale. To be honest, I don't actually know how Razer and Corsair compete with this thing on the market. Fourth, the adjustable weight may not seem like a big deal but if you're newer to PC gaming it'll offer you some versatility that others overlook.<br /><br />If you've been looking for a sign to switch gaming mice, this is it.

1.0,"Worth it, if you're lucky","It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage. The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't. Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently. There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling ""g502 double click"" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click.<br /><br />I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals. Now it's not the plastic it's made of.<br /><br />edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review. I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory. After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it. I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof. I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020. They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020. I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty. Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them. Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking.<br /><br />I will never buy a logitech product again.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored.

1.0,Last time I buy a Logi mouse,"This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime. I bought this to back up my G903 mouse (that also broke in under 2 years). Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well! It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products. Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled.<br /><br />What's wrong with this new G502? Plenty.<br /><br />It just started up, and it's a doozy. The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when... I'm not even... touching the mouse? Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with. Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again.<br /><br />What was wrong with the G903? Bad, cheap, switches. I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput. Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic.<br /><br />After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed. I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues. And trust me when I say, you're probably better off biting the bullet and just buying a mouse from a different brand. I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service.<br /><br />GG, I got played. It is what it is. Stay away from Logi mice until they decide to actually listen to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing issues from Logi mice.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFGWHCP6UZIH4KG4OVSUUABUDE3Q,1615486462698,4,True

So typically it becomes a bit of a struggle to get it in a good position, but thankfully it is still good for a palm grip because its very long, youll just be dragging your palm on the mousepad a lot and your pinky and ring fingers will have a hard time figuring out where to go.

2.0,This mouse is not safe from Logitech's fatal flaw,"I bought this mouse in summer 2019, giving Logitech one last go after having at the time just lost yet another Logitech mouse to the double-click issue. I thought maybe a $50 mouse would be made of some tougher stuff, but it began double-clicking occasionally after only 6 months. A year later, it has gotten to the point that I am looking for a replacement. I am also having issues with the scroll wheel failing to register when I attempt to scroll up, a problem I've never had with any other mouse before.<br /><br />For those not in the know, the issue I'm talking about causes the mouse to register multiple clicks from one tap of the left mouse button, causing double-clicks when you intend to do single clicks, and randomly registering additional clicks while attempting to click and drag. It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable. This is caused by Logitech using cheap switches that break quickly, and despite years of people complaining about this, they have not done anything about it, I guess because it's a net win for them as long as the warranty has expired before the problem starts.<br /><br />At this point I am convinced that the only way to avoid this problem is to find another brand for my next mouse. That said, I gave this 2 stars because it was great for those first 6 months. It would probably be a solid purchase for someone who feels confident enough to take the mouse apart and solder in higher quality switches, but that's not me, and I imagine, not most consumers. Otherwise, maybe find a brand that is less shameless about their planned obsolescence.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFKUHBHIBDXFNYULNDRYHKF2CLAQ,1609214225923,1,True

2.0,UPDATED: OK quality; heavy; scroll wheel is a problem; not durable,"UPDATED: The mouse broke after less than a year.  The switch under the left mouse button wore out, and now dragging with the mouse is treated as a series of clicks (which of course does the wrong thing).  I'm reducing my rating from 3 stars to 2.<br /><br />This mouse has excellent feel and high precision.  The drivers are reasonably easy to use, and you only need them to program the mouse, not to use it.  This means you can use the mouse on another machine, including any customization, without installing software.  I don't use all the extra buttons, but they seem like they'd be nice for gaming.<br /><br />There are two significant downsides to this mouse.  First is the weight.  This is a pretty heavy mouse with a base weight of 121g.  Customizable weight is nice and all, but it doesn't help if you think 121g is too heavy to begin with.<br /><br />Second, the scroll wheel.  You can either unlock it for continuous scrolling, or lock it for clicky, discrete scrolling.  But the continuous scrolling is too smooth even for scrolling through documents, and the discrete scrolling is loud and has too much resistance.  This makes the scrolling functionality significantly worse than most generic mice I've used.<br /><br />The mouse is oriented toward a palm grip.

And it doesn't seem that I'm the one who keeps getting issues, it's a flaw in the construction. It's especially frustrating when trying to work and be productive because the double click causes a lot of issues with editing work or creating assignments. And when you're gaming, you're at a major disadvantage because it double clicks more in games than in general use. I play fps games most of the time (for example rainbow six siege) and when I try to shoot it stops shooting, it doesn't go full auto, Also for general use, when watching youtube whenever you want to pause it will sometimes put you in fullscreen.

5.0,Great Mouse only one con,Been using the Logitech g502 Mouse for several years now first gaming mostly World of Warcraft and OverWatch as well as Diablo . I always buy a new one when the old one gets worn out. The only con I have to say about this product is that I feel like the left or right click wear out out a little quicker than they should especially if you play any sort of gaming MMOs where there's a lot of consistent left or right clicking especially with shooter games. I found with almost all my mice that eventually either the left or right click touchpad starts to wear out and the click doesn't always work or goes in and out. Besides from this issue it's my most favorite Mouse and will continue to order them in the future. The only thing that needs Improvement like I said is the durability and quality of the left and right click pads that register your clicks which seem to wear out too quickly which makes left and right clicking intermittent at times so shooting MMOs when you're holding down left click your shooting will start and stop start and stop because the pad that registers you clicking goes in and out. But aside from that it's an amazing Mouse and very comfortable which molds to my hand just perfectly.,[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AELLLEOQSFNY5CZOUOUWDIOOAITQ,1649250927132,0,True

2.0,Decent mouse ruined by terrible Logitech software,"Here's the bottom line for this mouse. It's got average ergonomics, above average buttons and placement, but is spoiled by the terrible Logitech GHub software.<br /><br />This mouse doesn't have any onboard memory, which means the Logitech software *has* to be running at all times for you to use anything but the basic functions. If it closes on you (which... it will), you immediately lose any functions you've set on those extra keys until you reopen the software. I use this mouse on both my Mac and PC. The interface is poorly designed, and I've yet to have it detect different games when they run on my PC. The Mac software has even reset itself a couple times in the 3 weeks I've had it, meaning I have to go back and remap everything, reset the mouse speed, etc. Also beware, Little Snitch shows that the G Hub software does phone home to Logitech. You can't be sure what it's sending back and forth, especially when you're required to give it full access to your machine for it to function.<br /><br />To cap it off, Logitech has *specifically* designed the extra buttons on this mouse so that they cannot be detected by any software other than G Hub. Typically you could use an alternative like USB Overdrive or Steermouse on Mac to map buttons, but that's not an option. To be clear, that is a deliberate design choice by Logitech to lock you in to their awful software.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEOO43YQQQQ5LNCFJVDVBDCDD6YQ,1628275322915,0,True

No double clicking or sensor issues or anything like other reviewers have posted here. But at about three months or so, the scroll wheel started doing this weird click whenever I scrolled. I decided to ignore it and thought I would get used to it. But after a short time, it started clicking more frequently while scrolling. It does function correctly, but it's just too annoying and it just feels like it's going to fail at any moment, and I won't have the scroll wheel working anymore. It is so dumb to not like a product for this minor issue. But when you use it all day in a quiet environment, you can't help but feel annoyed because you notice it all the time. I think it's because of the free scroll function it has that contributed to this issue since I had a Razer Basilisk V3 (ewwww) that also had issues with the scroll wheel.

A+++  (don't pay more for wireless)<br /><br />Where it fails:  Size of an animal mouse. Might be for a specific type of grip style?  Cat food style?<br /><br />Meaning, it fits fine if you use your pinky and ring finger pads to push into the right side of it.<br />I drag my pinky and ring finger very loosely off the right side, on to the mouse pad.<br />ANY other grip is PAINFUL.  If you do not drag your 2 extra fingers on the table, you end up holding them up with nothing to support them underneath.  That will cause your fingers to wear out quickly, say in 2 minutes.

5.0,Great for a console gamer converting to PC!,"About a year ago I decided to get back to PC gaming. I had started streaming and after mostly PS4 content with an underwhelming laptop to boot, I upgraded to a desktop last year which came with a good “gaming mouse”. It was comfortable to use so I never put much thought into it.<br /><br />About a month ago I decided to look around for a mouse though to see if it was even worth upgrading, talked to a few friends and they all recommended the G502. I’ve known the Logitech brand for quite a few years and have used their cheaper wireless mice for my laptop so figured I’d give this one a shot. And holy cow is this an awesome mouse.<br /><br />The customization features in the Logitech Software alone is super easy to use and make adjustments for later. Set different levels of sensitivity for my needs, set up the extra mouse buttons for different purposes in different games. I’m still struggling to adjust to a mouse and keyboard after having a controller in my hands for almost three decades, this mouse has greatly assisted in my transition into the PC world.<br /><br />Console gamers looking to dive into PC, give this mouse a shot, it has enough customization options to fit just about anyone’s needs.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG7SKKRPSTAHX4YINBIHIAWWHRXQ,1606358778834,0,True

2.0,Unable to use extra buttons and the ones you can use wear out fast,"Despite having extra mouse buttons, you can't actually utilize them as mouse button binds in games. Logitech's software only lets you bind them to actions recognized by the software, which makes them practically useless for gaming. Windows and other operating systems have support for mouse buttons above 3, it's disappointing to see this completely absent from a multi-button mouse. At least you can set a high sensitivity/DPI in the mouse firmware.<br /><br />Additionally, after just 4 years of use, the right mouse button has started double clicking for me. Searching online yields many reports of this happening to others, and the only way to fix the problem is to destructively take apart the mouse body and clean some contacts, and then try and somehow put it back together again. And, this is only a temporary fix.<br /><br />As for the scroll wheel, well, you can use it for vertical scrolling, but even when you unlock it for smoothly turning the scroll wheel, it still sends individual scroll events to the OS, even with Logitech's software installed, so there's no point to the smooth scrolling behavior as the OS can't detect it. It is nice to be able to tilt the scroll wheel left and right for horizontal scrolling at least, not many mice have that feature. However, I couldn't find a way to customize the speed of horizontal scroll events being sent to the OS.<br /><br />Perhaps the only good thing is that you don't need to keep Logitech's software installed - it writes the configuration to the mouse and then you can use the mouse with any device without having to ever touch the software again. Do not buy products that only work when you run their software in the background, it's a waste of system resources at best and spyware at worst. Thank you Logitech for letting the mouse functionality work without the software installed.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFHR3LNBWDOBLDTQBYGQ7HWURKEQ,1662079276810,0,True

So I bought the 502g despite seeing a lot of flak online for these being basically bricks after a short time of use.<br /><br />I trusted that even if the 502g had issues certainly revisions had fixed the issues with double clicking and left click failure that many had reported before.<br /><br />It took a mere 3 months of light use on my gaming mouse to become nearly unusable.  Which I'm sure to an average gamer would be a month or less.<br /><br />Don't buy it, you will regret it.  Listen to the naysayers, the product is just of a purely inferior quality.  I could have got a cheaper mouse that I know would have been reliable and served my needs but I spurlged because of my respect for Logitech quality and I was let down.

I am quite sure I got a great deal with this mouse.<br /><br />The sensor in this thing is insane. It is very accurate. The button placement is really good, with your fingers landing closely to them, but still managing to be confortable.<br /><br />The weights are a good plus.

Unfortunately, the software is unavailable to those on Linux.<br /><br />The mouse also has memory inside of it. If you would like to use the mouse how you want in Linux, I recommend using a Windows machine first and to setup the bindings and RBG lighting there first.

2.0,The fit is awkward and hurts my hand!,"Initially I was going to review this as one-star, but I bumped it up to be a little more fair-minded. Obviously aesthetic wise, this mouse kills it. But that's honestly where the advantage stops in its tracks, unfortunately. In basically every other area, this mouse is cheaply built and designed. My current mouse - A Razer Basilisk mouse - easily defeats this in all other specs. It's just not even worth a comparison to be honest.<br /><br />I'm actually using it as I type out this review. The clicking noise is driving me crazy; it's not very subtle. The right-click is just slightly more bearable.  The scroll wheel feels cheaply made and there is simply no friction to it as I slide it up or down. There's an annoying pop-out button where I usually rest my thumb. The fit is not as comfortable or even achievable by my somewhat large hands. I have to force myself to bend my hand to accommodate the mouse's slim design,  and not the other way around. The Razer mouse indeed molds itself around my hand, a marvelous design. This mouse is basically AWOL, leaving behind a hollowed out and slim shell that basically sums itself up as, ""Take it or leave it"". Well, I can definitely say message received.<br /><br />So back in the box it goes, and can I say what an abysmal failure this has been. It was an impulse buy after reading product review sites, and sometimes that does work out but in this case it seems it has not. I have respect for Logitech on the brand as a whole, but this is just a sad, under-developed product that I would be ashamed to ever be supporting. I have rated it a full star more due to consideration that this product just might not be for me, and perhaps it can be for most others, but most definitely it is not my style or preference. On the ergonomic aspect of it I would rate it 0/5 if I could, it is simply that bad. There is a dull ache that travels up my hand if I rest it on the mouse for even a minute or so. Also, I might have mentioned this but I just cannot seem to rest my thumb anywhere due to a protuberance that I understand is a button. This is quite simply  put just terrible design, one of the worst I have ever had the misfortunate to experience firsthand. 2/5 stars",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGUEBW53MSL4SUAPHGP2KHKDKEEA,1605976805455,0,True

4.0,Is the 502 right for you?,Let me start this of by saying oh my the buttons. Coming from a simple left/right scroll mouse this was a shock to me especially relating to how I hold this mouse. With the ridiculous amount of toggles you are met with an endless array of control mapping as long as the program/game registers those as applicable binds. (some do not unfortunately and will register that button to a key on your keyboard as well overwriting it’s original bind) The mouse itself is quite hearty but has a solid feel to it and features the endless scroll function on the mouse wheel. Also the sensor is wonderful and can be adjusted up to 16000 dpi which no ordinary human would need. One flaw I would like to point out would be the feet on this mouse. They really hold the whole 502 hero package back feeling cheap and overall lacking quality commonly found on mice within the “gaming” genre of peripherals. If you have larger hands and like the feeling of a hefty mouse this is a valid contender as I’ve come to enjoy using it very much,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k5TlKNwbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k5TlKNwbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k5TlKNwbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYwFHd4ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYwFHd4ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYwFHd4ML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vOmAH10qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vOmAH10qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vOmAH10qL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH7PBDJQM4ZQ4XIK2XS7CZEL6XCA,1613107111372,1,True

The replacement’s scroll wheel is noticeably better, but then I noticed another defect on the first mouse that didn’t catch my attention initially. The replacement mouse has four pads/feet on the bottom, whereas the initial mouse only has three—it’s missing the thin pad right below the G502 Hero logo. But here’s the kicker: the pad on the replacement mouse was misaligned and sticking up at its smallest point! I was easily able to pull it off and glue it into its proper place, but now the lack of replacement pads—which should come standard with mice in this price range—worries me.<br /><br />The G502 Hero is a great mouse design, but unfortunately I’m not convinced it’ll last very long.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEUNDY4KCZ7NTHLRLYYNZNWIUNBA,1600818617657,0,True

4.0,Not a good replacement for the G500 if you have bigger hands,"I had been using a g500 for almost 10 years. I loved that mouse as someone who uses a full palm grip and has larger hands. When the buttons finally started to give me the double click failure I looked around for a solid replacement. I was recommended the g502 from multiple people and read about it as a replacement on multiple sites. I pulled the trigger and grabbed one because my other mouse was not really functional anymore. The mouse does good clicky things, all the buttons feel solid and the mouse is responsive. The thumb rest is great well positioned, but the mouse is too narrow overall for a good palm grip. I also use a write pad with my mouse and so the sharp falloff combined with the narrow body mean that only half my palm is actually on the mouse. I either have to scrunch my hand up to keep my hand off the pad or drag part of my hand around. I think this mouse is probably an amazing mouse with someone with smaller hands, or someone who prefers a claw grip. However, if you got some wide hands like I do and use a full palm grip you might want to keep looking.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH5RSH3AODNUH34TWI6PF4B5D3CQ,1600902372927,0,True
5.0,"Nicely constructed, comfortable, weighted mouse.","I have very small hands, and the struggle is real when it comes to finding a gaming mouse. This mouse, is still fairly large for me, but compared to a lot of other gaming mice out there, the contours and just the shape of it allow my hand to feel more comfortable holding, resting on it, and using it.<br /><br />Pros: Comfortable. Adjustable weight. High quality build. Customizable dpi presets. Customizable rgb backlighting.<br /><br />Cons: Still fairly large for my hand. More buttons than I need (which is probably a pro for most people..lol). The software must load for your rgb settings to take. I think my biggest dislike is the convoluted and confusing software (Logitech Hub) that doesn't really give you clear instructions on how to use it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this mouse choice so far.

4.0,this mouse is not good for gaming.,"____________________CONS_____________________<br />weight:<br />This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming. When you try to flick with this mouse, chances are you'll overaim and miss due to the leftover inertia the mouse had. The fact that logitech would add attachable weights just  blows my mind. I've been using this mouse for the better part of a year now, and looking back at it, I regret that I didn't just buy a steelseries mouse instead.<br /><br />curvature of the mouse:<br />This could just be a ME problem, but my hands are fairly average-sized. This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk. If logitech added the thumb-rest bit, why couldn't they do the same for the pinky and ring finger?<br /><br />reliability:<br />This could also just be a ME problem. I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great. However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly. For example, spraying a gun in CS:GO. If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray. I've died countless times to this issue, and the same goes the the rmb. I don't abuse this mouse, never dropped it from even above KNEE height, and that's coming from a dude who's 5'7''.<br /><br />_____________________PROS_____________________<br />extremely customizable:<br />Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun. The feel of the material doesn't feel cheap at all (which for an 80$ mouse should be a given) and the curve of the mouse feels great on my hand.<br /><br />visually satisfying:<br />it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool. Nothing I could say could possibly change this.<br /><br />cool scroll button:<br />you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel. Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly.<br /><br />_____________________CONCLUSION_____________________<br />is it worth 80 bucks? No. You'd be better off buying a lighter mouse from steelseries, or maybe even a logitech g pro wireless when it goes on discount. Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech. Not worst, worse.

5.0,"A great gaming mouse, perfect for nearly every occasion","As of this writing, I'm currently overhauling my PC gaming setup. My previous mouse, a Corsair Dark Core RBG, had completely lost all functionality only after two years from purchase. I was blueprinting some ideas for a replacement and read a lot of great things about Logitech G products. I've used previous Logitech equipment some odd years ago for general computer use and thought I would take the plunge on the gaming aspect of the brand. Needless to say, i'm glad I did and the good reviews for this product are well-deserved.<br /><br />The mouse feels wonderful to hold. I was worried at first because it did feel a little light and hollow out of the box. This is where the included five 3.6g weights come into play. The weights act to give some stability for higher DPI settings and also give some weight to help with maneuvering the mouse on certain surfaces. This part might actually be tricky upon getting it out of the box as I had to mess around and add/remove weights until I just got the right natural feeling when moving it. This was not too huge of an issue as even the Logitech website had recommended adjusting the weights until you feel what works. I'm glad the ability to change the weight was included as I have big hands and need an ample amount of weight for the mouse to feel great in my palm. The middle mouse wheel is unique in that it has a toggle button for a dual-mode use; one has the mouse wheel scroll freely and super smoothly (perfect for browsing or getting to the top/bottom of a page with just a quick flick) and the other mode is a ""scroll clicker,"" perfect for making precise digital art or designs or when you need to swap out to that second weapon in your favorite FPS. Its because of this that the mouse has more functionality beyond just gaming.<br /><br />The ergonomic build is great as well. No matter how I hold it, the mouse feels like it melds into the shape of my palm and thumb. The thumb rest is a nice addition too, keeping my thumb from sinking too low or dragging around my mousepad. The quality of the entire mouse is just awesome. Everything from the material used to the lighting effects and the design itself is perfect.

1.0,Amazing until it's trash 3-6 months in,"I've purchased this mouse (or more accurately returned this mouse 4 times.  4 TIMES.  My first purchase was approximately a year and a half ago.  I've never in my life had such an issue with a Logitech product.  Basically, it's an amazing mouse, and what you'd expect from Logitech products, until one of two things happens.  First begins the double clicking out of nowhere.  You click, you get 2 clicks.  Then comes the middle mouse button depress issue where it's basically stuck down permanently and doesn't function properly.  Here's the hilarious part.  I just went back to the store 30 minutes ago with the same issue for the 3rd time (I live in AK so my options for a mouse at 7:45pm are quite limited).  The guy at the counter said he has the same mouse (for 3 years now) and it feels the same as his which ""works fine"" and ""his mom loves it"".  I said ""it feels like this""?  He said ""yes"".  I opened the new box and I said, yeah, yours is broken too, because THIS is how it's supposed to feel.  Also I'm pretty sure your mom loves it because she's using word and the internet, not trying to do anything real with it.  How ironic, his is broken too and he didn't even know it.  An absolute disappointment, Logitech.  I've tried to contact them and had the run-around as well, so I'm stuck exchanging it over and over because it's out of the return window.  Now I'm online to purchase the new re-release of the MX-518, the best gaming mouse in the history of ever and to pray they didn't use the same POS components from the Hero 502, so that I have a spare this time for when this one fails in 3-6 months.

3.0,6 Months,"Okay, I have been using this mouse for 6 months now, and I have started experiencing an issue now where the mouse with start acting erratically. What I mean by this is, let's say I move the mouse to the left, well, the cursor will go up and to the left, maybe 10% of the distance it should have gone. When I try moving to the right, it would move the cursor down and to the right, maybe 10 - 20% of the distance it should have gone. This will last for anywhere between 5 - 30+ seconds. Moving the mouse in a circular pattern usually seems to fix it, temporally. My friends that have this mouse have not had this issue yet, and they have had theirs longer. I feel I might have got a dud.<br /><br />--------------------- [ Older Review Below ] ------------------------<br /><br />I've been using a G702 for many years now, and the switches were starting to go, so it was time to upgrade. Well, seeing reviews and knowing some people using this I decided to get it, so I got it and I can say that it's nice, but I like the G702 a lot better.<br /><br />Before I go too far, most negatives are about double-clicking, I have not experienced that nor has my friend that is also running this mouse.<br /><br />So far, I really do like this mouse, but I do have a few minor grips, and this is what seems to be just on the one I got and not on all. But, the textured covering over the weights is dragging on the mouse pad, which means that the skatez on this mouse are too short. It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I shouldn't have to yet.<br /> ** (Update, put on new skatez over the ones that came on there, and it no longer drags.). **<br /><br />Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel. Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button. If the mouse was a little wider, I think it would be a bit more comfortable. This also may be because I am not use to it yet, but a little bump or something on the buttons along with being a little wider, those two small touches, I feel this could have been a better mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGCRDKOA24X2I7RAYJT2XOSBTKIQ,1634841482411,1,True

1.0,Broke within six months,"I am extremely disappointed with this mouse.  If you had asked me just one month ago what I thought of it, I'd say ""Great!""  It worked beautifully, it was very comfortable, and I liked all of the easy to access buttons on the side of the mouse.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked.  It seemed to do this randomly, and I'm still not certain if it makes a difference where I press down on the button.  It seemed like if I kept my finger dead center, it was a little more consistent.  Now even that doesn't work.  The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click.  In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button.  It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing.<br /><br />Words cannot begin to express my disappointment.  I bought some cheap 20$ mouse with less than 4 stars in review and it was one of my favorite gaming mice of all time, lasted me at least a couple of years.  This mouse was more expensive and lasted a measly six months, if that.  To add insult to injury, I didn't buy the extended protection plan, and the time to replace it has run out.  So it looks like I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident.  It's possible that this was a ""One in a million"" scenario.

3.0,Excellent features--misses the mark in practicality for me.,"I really wanted to love this mouse.  I am a casual gamer, and I thought this would up my game a bit with precision and programmable buttons, etc.  Sadly, after using it for an afternoon, I found to be a poor choice for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The smoothness of the sensing is excellent.  I felt my ability to pick precise targets in shooting scenarios would be enhanced compared to my old Microsoft mouse.<br />-The ability to switch the scroll button to free-wheeling is handy and satisfying.<br />-Materials do seem to be nice and solid.<br />-The weights are a nice touch for customizability.<br />-The lights add visual appeal without being too flashy.  Colors are customizeable.<br />-The quantity of buttons available is good, and their locations are easily accessible by fingers without accidental touches just from gripping the mouse itself.<br />-The sliding surfaces on the bottom are smooth and large.<br />-The feel in my larger than average hands was nice.  Ergonomics were good compared to a more standard shape.<br />-The thumb button for engaging low DPI would be good if I could get used to it.<br />-The multiple profiles available for single or multiple customized DPI & programmed button settings is nice.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There's too much resistance on the scroll wheel when free-wheeling is disengaged.  When my fingers were dry, they would actually slip on the metal wheel surface instead of rolling it.<br />-The left/right bump buttons on the scroll wheel are easy to press, but the center scroll button is hard to press.  I found it very difficult to consistently press only the center scroll button.  Most of the time I was accidentally pressing down and left or right at the same time.<br />-My habit of wedging my thumb against the mouse pad and mouse for extra precision is not possible with this mouse due to the ergonomic wing shape on the left side.  I found this highly annoying, and it made it harder for me to hit targets.  If I could get used to toggling the DPI on the fly, this might be ok, but for $50 I don't want to work that hard to love it.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGMHOA47GGEXW5WLTKQZOFW624CA,1586468341712,0,True

I didn't even look around for other mice before buying this one. The mouse itself seems to look pretty much the same, but the software is vastly different and worse and makes configuring the mouse miserable.<br /><br />Some of the app's features flat out don't even work, like muting audio input. The app's interface is also awful. There are only a few settings but almost a dozen different screens with mostly redundant information and options. Everything is just disabled if you prefer on-board settings. You cannot directly edit an on-board profile, which was a core functionality of the previous app. It may be better if you wanted to use the 'game profiles' feature but I think that's a sad excuse to permanently run a spyware program that scans all your installed programs and processes just for your mouse settings (just use the games' settings...).<br /><br />The old app and onboard setting had its issues but actually worked, so I find these problems to be pretty glaring.<br /><br />Update 2/22: this mouse has intermittent jumping issues and the software has not improved.

My old Proteus Core worked for 3 years without issues until I replaced it. Same with the Logitech iFeel Optical (bought that 2 decades ago and never failed on me). It is a real shame that Logitech clearly decided to ignore the issue plaguing this mouse. I like the ergonomics and the features (I really like mice with ""sniper"" buttons), but if the mouse doesn't last 6-12 months its just not worth.<br /><br />Logitech did replace the mouse, but it started having issues as well after 8-12 months. Same thing with the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum. Loved that headset (Battlefield 1/V sounds amazing. Love the directional/positional audio) but it is plagued with issues as well.

3.0,"Doesn't last nearly as long as it should, and product support is difficult.","For the first half a year I had this mouse I loved it. It felt well made, it worked well, it was responsive, and I liked the segmented scroll wheel style. Then about half a year in, my right mouse button started being a little flaky. I didn't care that much because I didn't notice it too much and I was able to deal with it. However, the issue kept getting worse. First the right mouse button wouldn't register that I was holding it down and only sent across a single click. I play a decent amount of FPS Games. Randomly unscoping because your mouse isn't registering that you are holding the right mouse button is really frustrating. More recently, the right mouse button will randomly decide to not respond at all. I would normally take this as a factory defect, however when looking for a fix online, I've seen many different people having this issue, and saying they've gotten replacements sent in that have all had the same issue. I cant say that I've had multiple of these mice fail, because of my second point, Logitech's support website sucks. I've tried 3-4 different times to register my mouse so I can RMA it. Every single time I try, I get a message that I have registered the product, but when I go to my list of registered products, I don't see anything. I can't submit any tickets, I can't do anything there. I'm never going to get a Logitech product again. I've had good experiences with my headset and keyboard so far, but if they follow the trend that my mouse has set, They'll start failing within half a year and I'm not going to keep paying premium prices if what I get only lasts as long as a 15 dollar generic version.<br /><br />Edit: I can't say I was entirely unbiased for that review. I'm upping the stars to 3 because of a few reasons. One, I have yet to find a gaming mouse that doesn't have reviews about the double click issue. And two, if you use Logitech's virtual assistant or whatever they call it on their support site to submit a ticket, it seems like they get back to you in a reasonable amount of time. I haven't finished the ticket process yet, so I may edit this review yet again if it goes badly, however, I felt that the review I gave previously was a little too harsh.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF2O5ATAJMOI5ZMEXXFGJZZQVOAA,1613400237391,0,False

After a while the middle click starting giving out and I decided to change it up & get this mouse and a Logitech G Pro TKL keyboard.<br /><br />So far It's been great.

ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim.  They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one.<br /><br />So, in summary:<br />- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added!<br />- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS  >:-[<br /><br />If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out.<br /><br />Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix. I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but... nope.  That's right, the expensive (well... more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF2RAOMLEYONGLXVF7OH6JLJRSAQ,1594866936149,1,True
2.0,It does indeed double click,"my g502 hero didn't start double clicking until roughly half a year of using it. Most clicks are double clicks now. other than that, this mouse has a very unique scroll wheel design. The ability to switch between a infinite scroll wheel and other regular type seems like a rare/one-of-a-kind design. iv used a few dozen different mouses, and for some reason no other mouse can have this design.  g502 scroll wheel might dunk on every other mouse scroll wheel in the world. but the mouse cant go a year without double clicking regularly. the absolute top tier scroll wheel with a bottom tier right/ left trigger. Other that, this is generally a heavy mouse with alot of other average characteristics.

1.0,Left Mouse Button Failure and Middle Mouse Button Not Useable,"I purchased this mouse less than a year ago and recently began to have issues with the left mouse button registering multiple clicks on press. I went to a web app that shows mouse events and the issue seemed to be caused when any pressure is applied off center (like near the edges of the button). It would register up to 10 clicks if I pressed once along the edges and held down for a few seconds before releasing. I've looked into this problem here/elsewhere and it seems to be faulty switches being used for this series.<br /><br />Another issue I've had since the beginning has been the middle mouse button. In addition the scrolling up/down and middle mouse click, you can also rock the middle mouse to the sides to click a middle left/right input. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to click the middle mouse button without ""accidentally"" clicking the middle left/right button instead. From comments here, it seems to be a crap-shoot on whether you get a easy to use middle mouse button from this model. I debated on returning the mouse from the start, but I've gotten around this by simply disabling the middle mouse button entirely (and remapping to another button) while keeping the left/right middle mouse buttons functionality...I lost a button on the mouse, but still had plenty mappings for what I used it for (have another MMO mouse for games needing more buttons). My brother has a Razer Trinity mouse and I have another previously mentioned Logitech MMO mouse with this same button feature and have no problems clicking all 3 middle mouse buttons without issue.<br /><br />I'm going to try to RMA this mouse, but If I could go back I would have returned at the start.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AF4L547VQ647U2FXTHBX2KIIC3OQ,1594220433534,0,True

Some may not like this feature, but when you change your profile to switch the DPS it pops up as an alert, I'm sure it's something you can disable as well, but it tells you the current DPS setting, so its faster than looking at the LEDs on the mouse for reference.

While these nuances were frustrating and tedious, it did not attract much annoyance and dissatisfaction as it did when<br /><br />THE MOUSE WOULD PERIODICALLY STOP FUNCTIONING IN MOVEMENT DESPITE OTHER BUTTONS WORKING AS INTENDED<br /><br />I'm not sure whether this is a shipment issue that damaged the product, which is unlikely considering the package was pristine, or simply a defective product that was sent to me. Either case this should not be an issue when spending $80 on a advertised high quality mouse. Honestly disappointing.

5.0,Great mouse for people with medium to large hands.,"[[VIDEOID:dc59d9a4984144aa05787146fd0a5897]] So far the 502 is living up to the high logitech standards I'm used to. I needed a replacement for my old G402, the left button switch was randomly double clicking on single press. The 402 lasted me a few years and I was sad to see it go.<br /><br />Just like the 402, the 502 Hero is good for people with larger hands. It's slightly smaller as you can see in my pics, but hardly noticeable. The buttons schemes are almost identical which made the transition to the 502 seamless. The shape of the mouse is comfortable and easy to get used to. The thumbrest is large which may take up some real estate, so beware of you have limited space.<br /><br />One thing I'm a little apprehensive about is the scroll wheel. It rattles around and seems to shake the entire mouse when scrolling in regular mode, not hyperfast mode (free spin). Also the left and right wheel tilt buttons have too much play. This may or may not be a problem in the future but I didn't take a star away because it's only slightly annoying. I'll update if it gets worse.<br /><br />The feet seem good it glides across my mousepad with ease. There is slightly more friction than my old 402, but that may just be because it's not broken in yet.<br /><br />All in all it seems like a good buy, but if you get it on sale then it's almost a MUST buy. There are enough features for the hard core gamer and it's easy and comfortable enough to use for the average gamer.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BuxEkEDHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BuxEkEDHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1BuxEkEDHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13-xWBN9PS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13-xWBN9PS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13-xWBN9PS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19bJ+mcTbS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19bJ+mcTbS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19bJ+mcTbS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1RdSh7-w8S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1RdSh7-w8S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1RdSh7-w8S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFSV36WTSGX2YZGJNFWQU5MBIMNA,1608458120327,0,True

Also, the  Ghub crap, I say crap because that is what it is. It rarely discovers the mouse, only when it feels like discovering the mouse is when it is useful. Otherwise, its a waste of programming. Do not, I repeat do not use this for gaming. It will only on certain occasions work. As when I bought this mouse, I wanted to use it for gaming to replace an older mouse. What a poor decision that was on my part. Ghost scrolling consistently. As fort the buttons, they seems fine. For what it's being used for they will suffice.

3.0,I wouldn't choose this again.,"So I got this for Christmas of 2019, and loved it. It feels great every time I touch it, it looks nice. Out of the box, its a great mouse. Prior to using the g502 hero I had used a stock dell pc mouse and it served me well enough for a very solid ten years. I will likely be returning to that same model.<br /><br />Within six months of casual gaming use the right click started failing. Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy- Every game I played. I wanted so badly for this mouse to work out, because as I said, it feels really great to use. Eventually the failing right click started getting me killed and causing other issues, screen camera catching because the button stopped sensing that it was being pressed, etc.<br /><br />I was pretty pleased with Logitech customer service when I contacted them. Though it took awhile, they did replace the mouse since it was under warranty. For a time after that, everything was cool again. But now, a few months since receiving the replacement mouse, the issue is happening again. This time with the left click. All told I have spent almost exactly a year with the G502 hero, about six months with each one. And while I rate it extremely high on comfort and utility, I can say in no uncertain terms that I would not buy it again. Its lovely when it works. I tried to be patient with it, and with logitech. My stock dell mouse absolutely destroys this g502 hero in durability.<br /><br />To be clear, I'm not rough on these things. I don't have so much money that I can just buy 40-90$ gaming equipment every few months when it fails because the manufacturers decided to be cheap. What I do get, I take care of and expect it to last awhile.<br /><br />Tl/dr: Its a very nice mouse made extremely poorly with less durability than a gold pickaxe.<br />If you have plenty of cash and have no qualms with replacing your gear every 3-6 months, go for it.<br />If you want a quality piece of hardware that's going to be worth your money, definitely look elsewhere.

Going a little more into the software, I have the color pattern matching my keyboard that's also Logitech, so it's fun watching the colors change together. One nice hardware feature is that you can change the scroll-wheel speed; by default, it clicks and stops after each click, or you can press a button and it changes to a continuous mode where it has no friction stopping it.

5.0,Affordable price for a high/higher end mouse due to Amazon discount. 30ish seems perfectly fine.,"The G503 is an excellent mouse for palm grip or my own hybrid palm/finger grip. Although I don't use it for gaming. For desktop duty it is excellent. The extra buttons are positive even if rarely used by myself except mostly Foward/Backward side buttons. The hyperscroll wheel is very good and nice so in non-hyperscroll mode or normal mode. The finger doesn't get fatigued from scolling, there is mechanical feedback and it can jar the index finger a bit, nothing serious most likely a reason for controlled hyperscrolling without letting the wheel become a flywheel. Although the mouse wheel is excellent a pure metal one. Similar to prior hyperscroll mice from Logitech's other lineup. Much welcome improvement over the old plastic scroll wheel and older encoders of mice from yesteryears.<br /><br />The G503 is affordable when discounted from it's normal 50 or so dollars for a high-end mouse at about 30ish for it's current price range is a nice discount. Especially for those who wish to have a nice high-end mouse without paying high-end prices. Although there is a myriad of mice available Logitech once again built a workhorse. Funny the mouse came out originally around a few years ago and is still a proper mouse for gaming or more so desktop duties.<br /><br />Again gaming wise I cannot comment as I do not game anymore. But looking at websites from various tech sites around the internet. The Logitech HERO engine system(ARM 32-bit + Sensor) reveals an excellent sensor perhaps a bit dated after a bit of time but still a capable mouse for gaming. Or desktop duties as I use it for which any engine is good if you want a high/higher end mouse.<br /><br />The P.O.S.T.(Power-On Self Test) for the ARBG cycling at the beginning of boot for my computer during USB powering. Is an excellent idea. I have no idea if Logitech ever explains that but I'd like to see more companies and Logitech themselves mention the P.O.S.T. so the device can perform a electrical test to ensure proper operation and maximum M.B.T.F. I'm sure the ARM processor used or any processor from any company can include a routine of P.O.S.T. like a computer to run a power cycle test for normal operations.<br /><br />I'm sure as others can attest this mouse can last years so long as it doesn't break down or anything. Either way Logitech's return policy is considered by some to be good to reasonable. If the old MX518 and the resurrected second generation MX518 from recent release a few years ago are a testament to Logitech.

I decided to move on from the Corsair mouse I liked after I went through two in 4 years. When a mouse is ~$100 it shouldn't break from moderate use. I was looking for something that felt nice and I could stand it breaking in the next two years. This feels nice. The weight adjustment is a nice feature, and the handful of programmable buttons is great. I use various macros or prefer to have some oft-used keys on in reach of my thumb quite a bit. The G Hub software is easy to use, so getting all set up the way I wanted took less than 20 minutes.<br /><br />After I read another review after thinking the scroll wheel just sucked, I was very satisfied. I initially thought there was no tactile feedback to the wheel, but there was a button for it! It must have come in one position, or I accidentally hit it, but once I clicked it everything felt great. My only other issue is I keep accidentally pushing the DPI shift button at the tip of my thumb consistently.

5.0,Build quality is the BEST part.,"Cant say much about this mouse in detail, as I’m not too keen on this like mouse accuracy, DPI, and other things, but if I could guess, I’d say this mouse does those things perfectly fine. It has such a massive DPI range for anyone looking to fine tweak it, a G Huh app that can reassign buttons and functions and even change the backlight on your mouse. It’s a very stacked mouse, especially when you consider all that you’re getting, people hate the whole wired niche but, I hate having to find new batteries so there’s that lol.<br /><br />The build quality and weight is truly what makes this feel like no other. It is...SO...premium, to me. It has this metallic feel or maybe plastic, but GOOD plastic and it really feels like what upgrading from a Dualshock 4 to a Dualsense is (if you’re a playstation gamer, you know exactly what I mean) The build quality is an enigma and makes playing in this thing for hours a breeze, truly feels ergonomic.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHGH5JL6XOKVWUM5QFHAD6BMRIRQ,1638214272127,0,True

1.0,"1 year 10 months later, LMB click issues - random double click/can't drag windows - mouse unusable.","I first started having intermittent issues with dragging desktop icons, Chrome browser between 2 screen, along with additional browser tabs, and steam - the issues appeared coincidentally right around a big windows update, or at least from what I could tell - so I maybe figured that could of been the problem.<br /><br />I didn't have issues in games ironically for whatever reason, so I didn't think to much of it. Fast forward a few weeks later, I was playing a game (FPS), and I had trouble firing a machine gun out of nowhere after playing for several hours, where the gun would stop firing randomly, and I had to keep clicking the LMB. Now coincidentally the game also had a major update that had several bugs.  Played for several hours that day, and didn't have any issues, so chalked it up to maybe a bug that wasn't as common as the other ones. I restarted the game, and kept playing - once again the problem happened again not to long after. I started up a different game (RTS) that was more single click than like a FPS that you have to hold the button down for longer periods to fire for example , and within a short time of playing, started having issues with double clicking, randomly clicking on the wrong part of the map etc..<br /><br />Now at this point, I started suspecting the mouse to be a problem, swapped USB ports, and the problem persisted. I ended up plugging in another mouse, and well, everything worked without issues.<br /><br />Reviews longer than it needed to be probably, but that was the long version with my experience. I fully understand that stuff fails, statistically it's going to happen regardless of how great/reliable a product is. Although, with this if you look at other reviews, it's a pretty common occurrence it seems.<br /><br />That being said, I'm somewhat disappointed, this replaced a 11-12 year old Logitech G5 that was showing it's age - the pads on the bottom were pretty much worn down causing it to catch on the mouse pad, and the mouse buttons would stick somewhat mostly at cooler temperatures, it was also shortly after a new computer build, that, I figured I would compliment with a new mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGB6H3LMU6YPWLMJCN2CDLMWMHDA,1621183519232,1,False

4.0,"The Good, the Great, and the Ugly","This mouse is one of the most popular mice from the Logitech company, and it really shows. There are many great features in this mouse and some really bad things about it. So, let’s get into it! This mouse has 10 programmable buttons which is neat and useful if you want to do something quickly without having to do much work. Another big attraction is the free scrolling. By clicking a button on the mouse, you can toggle free scrolling which disables the scrolling limit, which can be useful if you want to get to the very top or bottom of website pages, or if you just want to mess around with it. In addition, there are customizable weights you can use which can make the mouse lighter or heavier. I don’t use them because I find the mouse just as good without any additional weight. The biggest features of all are the optical sensor the mouse has. The sensor on the mouse is the most accurate Logitech has made yet. In fact, just by putting your finger over the sensor, you will notice your cursor going crazy because your hand always moves even when you think you don’t. The mouse’s DPI (dots per inch) can be customized with 2 mouse buttons (on the side) or by using the Logitech G Hub. And yet I still haven’t talked about how good the mouse feels in your hand. If you have a big hand like me, then this mouse is perfect for you. The grip is good, the texture is good, it feels smooth, it’s everything you need for a mouse. There are still some bad things about it, though. The mouse is very dark, which can be a problem because it’s hard to see where each button is. Even worse, the RGB is not very noticeable because it’s only on 2 small spots on the mouse. And just as an addition to that, the tip of the 2 main mouse buttons is very sharp, too. And that’s all I got to say about this gaming mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEN2UMGAFPJX7YLKJ5PYVEZK5RQA,1651795126023,2,True

1.0,"Poor build quality, QC issues galore, bizarre design choices, downgrade from G500.","[[VIDEOID:240fdfa5afdb157e7dab261e6825b4d2]] Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones.<br /><br />The BAD:<br /><br />This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place. Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system. Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside. (By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a “manual”. Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure. What?! What happened with the button-push system?) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight. (No way they won’t break at some point in the future).<br /><br />As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way. There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom. That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside.). All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new “pro-gamer” plastic or metal pads. But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material. Wow, Logitech!? How the mighty have fallen!<br /><br />Another issue is plastic. Cheap plastic everywhere that is. Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making “Cool Gamer RGB overload” mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating. Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around… well, grind around let’s be honest. Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500. It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500. Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I’m sure is the target demographic now anyway.<br /><br />All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing. This mouse (G502) screams “cut-costs”, for the manufacturer that is. You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2.5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior. Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions. (The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven? How was this overlooked?! And then made by the million?)<br /><br />The GOOD:<br /><br />The sensor is top notch. While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance. Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502. Cord is pretty nice. Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality. Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used. Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse. 10 years ago this would have been a… well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some  kind. Now, even no-name “Gamer-Cool” brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15. It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad.<br /><br />I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand “Gamer-Cool” mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man’s hand, and actual metal feet.

3.0,"Probably Decent, but Scrollwheel was a Showstopper","I got this to replace a Logitech G403 Prodigy that I've had and enjoyed for 3yrs but recently developed a failing left-click switch.  I got this instead of another G403 because it was a little cheaper, apparently ""the most popular gaming mouse"", and has more buttons (though I don't think I'd really need all the extras).  Two issues immediately stood out.<br />First, my ring finger has a place to rest on the right edge of the G403, while this mouse doesn't quite have room for it, so I'd need to modify my grip to either squeeze it on with my middle finger, or drop it over the side.  It probably wouldn't be a huge deal in the long run, but I noticed the difference in ergonomics right away.<br />Second, and the reason I chose to immediately return the mouse and order another G403 (a HERO this time, because that's what's available) is the scrollwheel.  The G502 scrollwheel has a slick metal surface that's almost slippery, and a LOUD clicking in step-mode.  The button for switching to smooth scrolling is a nice feature, but in step mode it's just too clunky.  By contrast, the G403 has a rubberized wheel surface that requires very little force to use and light detents that silently provide just the right amount of feedback for stepped scrolling without adding appreciable resistance.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGGZZS6X44WS2JY4JX5D2TEMRNRQ,1617397543350,0,True

2.0,Flawed by design,"I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment. I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200. I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews.<br /><br />There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software.<br />In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good. It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect.<br /><br />THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL...<br />How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience? The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely. After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need.<br />However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine. The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all. And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw.<br />And finally, there is the rattling sound. As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside. It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying. There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling. Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible. But then I met the Logitech software problem...<br /><br />LOGITECH VS LOGITECH<br />I have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS). The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place. However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse.<br /><br />That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS. But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse.<br />G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse. Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken. G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros.<br />Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard. Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS.<br /><br />I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now.<br /><br />I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option. Besides, the mouse is not broken, it's just flawed by design.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlFNPAKrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlFNPAKrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MlFNPAKrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PU2G8oPSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PU2G8oPSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PU2G8oPSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFVUV7EAYNLC77JJS3ZJ6ZKUHDAQ,1617327053474,2,True

Oh speaking of fine aiming there is a dedicated button that if held goes to the lowest or which ever you set for your fine aim, which I abuse when using 6x or higher magnification so my finger doesn't accidentally press the mouse when hitting DPI up or down.<br /><br />As for ergonomics I use flat palm hold on my mice which this mouse is perfect for, you can also do semi claw too if you prefer that.<br /><br />This mouse is perfect for price to performance can't stress this point enough.

2.0,"Would have been great had it not been for a critical left-click, rapid-clicking issue.","I bought this mouse about six months ago and overall I was pretty content with it at first. The build quality seems good, the rubberized grips on the sides are nice, no issues with registration of movement, no issues of cable fraying and no issues with MOST of the buttons.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the button that DOES have an issue is the most important one: The Left-Click button. As of the past two months I intermittently (and more frequently) encounter an issue when trying to left-click or hold left-click, the mouse registers several left-clicks in rapid succession. You can only imagine how incredibly aggravating that is from a gameplay perspective down to something as simple as trying to drag a window across my screen only to have it drop the window and open a bunch of new tabs and randomly select everything.<br /><br />It's a shame because I know many people who speak very highly of this mouse, but little did I know that this is actually a common issue that I must have overlooked when researching this mouse. After looking into it, it seems like there are a lot of people who have reported this issue which makes me question if RMA'ing will even solve the problem or just prolong the inevitable.

It's fast, it's comfortable, and it looks nice. Only problems? Well, there's quite a few.<br /><br />The scroll wheel has two settings: free scroll and resistance scroll. The free wheel, while quiet, is annoying as all heck - while a great idea, it just doesn't work practically when in a game or document. As soon as you let it fly, it literally flies - to Neverland. I returned it for a mouse that eventually stops scrolling. lol The mechanical resistance scroll is really loud and difficult to move. So you basically choose between an uncontrollable infinite scroll or a ""stuck"" mouse wheel. There is no in-between.<br /><br />This mouse isn't advertised as ""noiseless,"" so I'll be a little easier on it. But it's so loud. So damn loud. I wanted a mouse that was quieter than my last one, but this one was louder.<br /><br />While this mouse has great DPI, it's hard to click and therefore reduces your time to react. Would not recommend for an FPS. I tried it in Destiny 2, and the thing just was ridiculously slow. You basically have to whack it to get it to shoot.<br /><br />However, it's a very comfortable mouse. The design is high quality and very well made.

3.0,Ergonomics aren't there my palming truckasaurus rex hands,"tl;dr: I have big hands, the mouse is too tapered for my palm grip and is uncomfortable. This mouse is better for claw grips. It's a cool mouse, but not for me. If only the back end was thicccc enough or my palm.<br /><br />I have large hands and from a diagram I was researching it was supposed to be one of the more larger sized mice. 7.5"" (~19cm) Middle to Base of Palm x 4"" (~10cm) across (from the base pinky joint to index joint).<br /><br />I bought this to replace my Razer Death Adder which is far more comfortable. I thought the Hero 502 felt narrow. Hero 502 measures ~60mm across as the gripping area, but so does the Death Adder. I think the problem is attributed to to the narrow tapering base where your palm sits.<br /><br />On the 502 Hero, there is only about ~60mm in diameter at the base, but it's tapered so much near the top, there is almost nowhere for your palm to sit on. (I like my palm grip when I'm aiming with my arm.).<br /><br />In Comparison with the Death Adder at around ~73cm in diameter, my palm sits comfortably. I've had a couple Razer products and I want to go try other things now. The current DE Chroma, somethings are wearing off/out. So it's time for a new mouse.<br /><br />Nitpicks: The scroll wheel is more like a flywheel. I don't want that much momentum when I flick that wheel around. I do like the idea of tilting the wheel, cool feature.<br /><br />Another nitpick is Ghub, I'm not familiar with it, but it did take a while for me to set up the DPI. And man that was down a couple of rabbit holes. I didn't realize GHUB had profiles for each game you had (Which can be a cool thing, but I was hoping the Desktop default was the global set for everything unless you manually change a profile for a game.<br /><br />Last nitpick about GHUB, if you have a library of games, you have to keep clicking over this long horizontal list of icons. Come on, why can't we set these to tiles of some sort? Or just a line by line list of games? Or a choice between all three?",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGWCWIGQFFJUZJIIHTC47RSVFXLA,1601769554390,0,True

3.0,Almost great,"Day 1 review, so just my initial impressions.<br /><br />Pluses: Build quality, weight, button feel are all on point.  Tracking seems accurate.<br /><br />Meh:  It's narrow, not great if you have larger hands (fine if not).  Weight is almost too much, even without the (seemingly) unnecessary extra weights (included) that you can install.  The 'thumb rest' (for right handed people anyway) is weird, though I think with more use it will be fine, maybe even a nice plus.<br /><br />Misses:  The mouse wheel.  It almost feels like an afterthought.  It's a solid plastic piece, with larger dips that probably double as grip texture and the mechanism to create the stops or 'speed bumps' when you scroll the wheel.  It has no other texture, isn't rubberized or textured in a way that helps prevent slippage.  It feels too smooth.  Couple that with the clunky 'speed bump' mechanism and it makes accurately scrolling the wheel difficult at best.  Definitely not a high performance feature, and honestly it doesn't work particularly well for normal use.  Not sure yet if it's a game-breaker, but it's at best a serious oversight.<br /><br />I'd love to love this, especially at the price point, but the wheel is such a constant issue that I'm not certain if it's something I can get past.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGNONDUQTV74CXZSXCIPXDZR2TOA,1615505562502,0,True

And there's way too much ghosting to ever have reliable precision.<br /><br />Since I work partially from home, I bought two of these, one for the office and one for home/gaming, so I could setup the same programming on both by utilizing the onboard memory. I have the exact same tracking issues on BOTH mice! I even bought a new mouse pad, which made no difference.

2.0,Not great quality,"I was looking for a replacement for my trusty R.A.T. 7 (which I would have kept if the drivers were available and working on my freshly rebuilt PC) but alas this is not the one. The biggest two things that led me to this purchase were the ability to add weights to the mouse and the sniper DPI toggle on the side. Both were a disappointment. The weights were the biggest issue. Aside from not really adding much weight to the mouse (I like a heavy mouse) the application was not great. There’s a panel that opens up on the underside of the mouse where the weights go that would not stay closed at all when all weights are in use. I figured out there was a manufacturing flaw where one of the weights specifically would not install correctly as intended and kept the panel from fully closing which is pretty unfortunate. Even with no weights used, the skates seemed to scrape and catch on my mousepad. Lastly, the DPI sniper toggle button on the side is so far up on the side of the mouse, your fingers nearly need to be hanging off the front end of the mouse to reach the button with your thumb.

Had to disable most of the extra buttons because re-adjusting hand positions caused all kinds of random things to happen.  Could never get the DPI dialed in right, either in windows or with the mouse utility (something you MUST install).  The wheel pretty much useless for windows or gaming.

After the fourth incident of having my opener in FFXIV ruined because an ability wouldn't go off when I clicked it, I swapped back to my older G502 and the problems disappeared. I'm incredibly disappointed, because I have enjoyed this mouse for so long, and was looking forward to continuing to do so.

My thumb is a little too short to reach it, without needing to reposition my hand;<br />-The USB cable is not braided nylon like the original G502; and<br />-For left-handed users, this mouse is pretty much a no-go, as it seems that the mouse is best suited to right-handed users, such as myself, based on the curvature of the mouse.<br /><br />Overall, the G502 Hero keeps the best of the G502, improves on the DPI a bit, but still leaves something to be desired in its design.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG5ZM2BZKUG2ICIMFH7HGU3X7JMQ,1672512046635,2,True

4.0,Frustrating customer support,"This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem.  Occasionally when using left click it sets off several rapid clicks at once, and would do the same when the mouse button is held.  No problem I thought, this has a 2 year warranty.  Except there is a problem.  Their support policies imply their customers are automatically dishonest and put a large burden on their customers to prove otherwise.  Aside from standard troubleshooting steps I was asked to go to a website to test the mouse clicker, no problem.  It was registering plenty of extra clicks.  Then I continued reading, and saw they wanted video evidence which met certain requirements:<br /><br />""Video needs to show the website on the screen and the mouse (physically and not just the cursor) together with a handwritten note of the ticket number at the same time.""<br /><br />This blew my mind!  They wanted me to do this while recording it all with my phone!  So I express my dissatisfaction with this and note that not everyone even has the means to do this, took a screenshot of the website and attached it.  This convinced the agent to go ahead and replace the mouse anyway, but even so the additional demands are frustrating.  I am being asked to destroy the product and provide photo evidence before they send the replacement.  So I have a mouse that is frustrating to use but at least it is better than no mouse, and they want me to destroy it before they send me a replacement.  I'll have no mouse for days.  The requirements for the evidence:<br /><br />Before the replacement product will be released, we request that you permanently disable your current product in a safe manner and provide us with pictures of the complete, disabled product from three different angles, one of these pictures should clearly show the product details such as PID/SN, and include a handwritten note with your case number (XXXXXXX) in each of the photos.<br /><br />I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives.  If I end up having to do this I'll be buying a new mouse from a company with better support before I follow through with disabling the mouse and getting the replacement I should have already gotten.<br /><br />EDIT: The agent went ahead and shipped the new mouse without requiring evidence of disabling the old mouse.  I could have waited a day to see their response but I was pretty frustrated.  While it is a shame I had to complain to get around these requirements they still accommodated me, so I've given back 3 stars for a 4 star rating.  Not counting my experience with customer support I would have given this mouse 5 stars.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHA3PWX5CERXSMYVB6NDD74COPDQ,1587507436722,1,True

Depending on the game the software craps it’s pants and glitches out the LEDs causing your mouse’s sensor to power down and back up. Meaning it stutters your game to hell making you have to turn the LED off.<br /><br />The two buttons, left and right wheel, really needs a stronger spring and a more pronounced click. It’s not really something you can macro other keys to because they’re unreliable.<br /><br />You need a super-flat surface to use the mouse on.

I feel in love with the original G502 so much that when it broke (by scrolling the mouse wheel when i wasn't touching it), I had my wife order 4 more of them for me.  Unfortunately the original were all gone, and they were onto the proteus spectrum.  I didn't mind this, as it added the RBG, but all 4 of those mice failed within 5 months with the left click button dying.  I managed to get 1 more after that (so 6 at this point) that lasted me decently, but after another year or so, even that one died.  Fast forward to now, and we are on the g502 hero and hero SE.  I ordered 2 hero's.  Those died within 2 months a piece.  Instead of going through the headache of the warranty system, I just ordered 3 more but now they were Hero SE's so I thought ""maybe they fixed it"".  Nope.  All 3 of these died in less than 2 weeks COMBINED across all 3 mice.  If you hold a click down, it just lets go all by itself.  Never in my history of mice have a had a design i love so much that fails so horrible.  My daughter also got 1 and hers failed in the same way within days.

4.0,Use D2FC-F-7N(G1) switches,I went down the switch rabbit hole after buying this mouse and reading all faulty switch reviews. So I bought some Kailh GM red 3.0 switches to replace the ones already there. But here is the thing. The left and right button are still D2FC-F-7N switches but have (G1) after them. Could not find out what G1 means. But D2FC-F-7N are Omron Chinese switches and are the ones that fail all the time. They are not micro current switches and just dont last.

1.0,"[UPDATED] Comfortable, top tier mouse; terribly faulty equipment","Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them. Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel. Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online? Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel.<br /><br />The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling. The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it.<br /><br />The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms. I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues.<br /><br />Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price. The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This is an update to the review I have written in the past, as things have gone an unfortunate route since then.<br /><br />A few months after I bought this mouse, I began to have problems. On occasion, my cursor would bounce erratically, or slide as if my mouse had disconnected like it were wireless, which is what I've previously mentioned in my original review. These issues were negligible at first, but they progressively got worse over time. It got to the point that playing games got very hard to play because of this fault. Of course, I thought my mousepad might have been dirty, or there could have been some grime/dust on the laser that was causing this, however, this isn't the case.<br /><br />I recently upgraded a few peripherals, including a brand new mousepad, which is entirely clear of any mess. I bought this mouse again, seeing how the old one is already falling apart after having it for almost a year. The moment I plug in my mouse, I almost immediately begin to have the same issue; erratic bouncing mouse, and a sliding cursor. I even double checked it on a laptop to confirm it wasn't my hardware, and it was, in fact, the mouse I had JUST bought.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with Logitech mice, as this is the second variant of Logitech mice I've bought that's been awfully faulty, but I will not be buying Logitech brand items anymore. It's ridiculous that my lightweight, casual use of them acts like I'm beating the mouse against my desk, and throwing it against the wall. It's such a shame, because I really liked the firmware, design, and feel of the mouse. They've lost my business, and any further recommendations to friends.

2.0,"Omron Switches and Scroll Wheel Issues, Avoid this Mouse!","I am writing this review after about 6 months of using this mouse. I bought this mouse as a replacement for my M720 Triathlon, which I had used for about a year and a half before then. The issue I had with the Triathlon was that it began to double click items when I only clicked them once, and I could no longer drag and drop objects across my desktop without the mouse ""dropping"" them along the way, despite the fact that I was still holding the button.<br /><br />When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old. I looked into the issue deeper and found that the culprit was the Omron switches used inside the mouse, for the left and right click. A number of people had suggested switching them for Kailh GM 4.0 switches, so I decided to fix this mouse instead of buying a new one. I bought four of the Kailh switches, and I and a friend replaced the old Omrons in both my G502 Hero and my M720 Triathlon, and now they both work flawlessly.<br /><br />The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told. I found it strange, however, upon opening the mouse to replace the switches, that the DPI Up & Down buttons, as well as the side DPI Button on the G502 Hero all use Kailh switches, while the left and right still use the Omrons. This is likely due to the Omron switches having been considered the higher quality option, at the time of this mouses inception, but by that point, I am certain Logitech was already aware of the issues that switch was facing.<br /><br />If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9 Months In<br /><br />After a few months since my review, it is now April, and the Hyperscroll feature of the device stopped working abruptly. I hadn't done anything to merit this, it simply quit. After dismantling the mouse (again), I found that the interior mechanism which allows switching between Hyperscrolling and traditional scrolling (which lets the scroll wheel spin freely) is a simple spring and a pin, with a plastic paddle, and a small gear system that allows the switch from one mode to another. When the paddle is engaged, it pushes the pin away from the scroll wheel, which allows the wheel to spin without clicking. When disengaged, the pin is pushed against the scroll wheel, which causes the familiar click/bump of scrolling. Pretty simple, except that whoever designed this mechanism didn't account for a few important aspects: The spring they used is about 4x too weighty for the job, and the pin is held in by... hope? I guess? there really isn't anything stopping the pin from moving side to side, and it can move too far from the paddle, meaning that when the paddle goes to make contact enough to push the pin away, it goes right by, and the scroll clicks regardless, as there's nothing to push it away from the wheel.<br /><br />Since the spring has way too much tension for its purpose, it does do an excellent job at one thing: pushing the pin right out of place. Two millimeters of plastic, on the edge of the paddle, to hold the pin in, would have stopped this, or making the pin go the whole way through, and adding a second mount on the other side of the wheel, to hold it in place. I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding. Unlike the Omron switches, which I can forgive as a possible oversight, as the choice to use them was likely misinformed with out dated information, the issues plaguing the scroll wheel should have been addressed before the mouse even reached production, as this is an easily noticed and easily amended flaw.<br /><br />All of these issues have driven my rating of this device from 5 stars, to 4 stars, and now 2 stars. I give the device 2 stars because, at the end of the day, it is user serviceable, and I like Logitech. I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me.

1.0,Absolute Worst Mouse Ever - I Can't Believe This,"I've owned many logitech mice. I had a G500 for many years and it was phenomenal. Of course nothing lasts forever (it stopped having issues after several years of use) so I ended up buying a G502 Hero mouse (because they no longer make the G500). This mouse has absolute garbage build quality and Logitech knows it.<br /><br />The first mouse I had of the G502 Hero got the dreaded clicking issue that a lot of people make mention of with this model. Where you go to click and it double clicks. Or if you're trying to drag and drop something, it randomly drops what you're dragging whenever it wants. Just doing basic things on your computer become a choir. So I got that mouse replaced and wouldn't you know, within months, the replacement that Logitech sent me started doing the same thing as the 1st mouse.<br /><br />So I ended up acquiring a 3rd mouse. Now, this 3rd mouse doesn't have the clicking problem yet (these mice all seem to get that issue with time) but the right mouse button's actuation is INCREDIBLY sensitive out of the box. I can't even rest my finger slightly on the right mouse button without it pressing down. I thought I was going crazy so I took my 2nd mouse of this model (which I still have) and rested my finger on the right mouse button and it doesn't press down the button. The build quality of this model is just pathetic. Oh, and I haven't even gamed with this mouse in close to 2 years. So basically all the problems I got from the first 2 mice, was from basic web browsing. So it wasn't like I was clicking the buttons a ton of times or smashing the mouse buttons that maybe one would assume could happen from gaming a lot. That's 3 mice that I've gotten from this model that all have serious issues. No wonder Logitech was selling this model for practically nothing when I first got it. They must have realized that the build of this mouse is terrible and they were just trying to give it away (I believe I got the first mouse for 20 bucks)",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFCFDCMMQFIYWSNI5CBUHED6HI4Q,1618280023126,0,False

2.0,Worked well until it didn't,"My Razer mouse broke so I bought this mouse as it was within my low budget and would fit my large hand. The reviews were also really good so I thought it would work well and last a long time.<br /><br />The mouse is heavy and feels very premium. It works just fine without any programs or special drivers, but I recommend the GHUB program since you can customize the sensitivity more precisely. I was a happy user until about 6 months in when the right click button started to not hold down. This normally wasn't an issue, but during games where you hold right click to aim, it made them unplayable. I got a replacement pretty quickly and didn't have any issues until about another 6 months later when it started having the same issue. I submitted a request for another replacement (or just a refund) and it took them about a week to respond. Ultimately, I just bought another Razer Deathadder (the V2 model this time), which is what I had before and is what worked fine for over 3 years.<br /><br />While I believe the original G502 was of high-quality parts and should last for a long time, this new HERO model clearly has problems with the switches and I wouldn't recommend it due to its reliability issues.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHO2PQXVDWI3BAGQIZ766PR4JMBA,1614896024156,0,True

5.0,"Great Mouse, Don’t listen to what people say...",I bought this mouse for Christmas and it was something that I had been looking at for 2 years now. I opened the box and it was awesome. I plugged it in right away and it worked great. All the other people in the reviews are saying that the scroll wheel is awful and that it spins freely. It doesn’t do any of that. The scroll whee has an awesome texture and it very smooth. Anyways who is going to care about the scroll whee in competitive gaming??? And the scroll wheel DOES NOT break and spin freely. There is a button the top of the mouse that switches between freely spin mode and regular scroll wheel mode. The sensor is absolutely amazing and the software is very intuitive. You can change the color of the G logo and the dpi lights as well as the function of the buttons. The ergonomics of it is amazing.

2.0,Mediocre Mouse That Didn't Last,"I ignored the reviews that reported the double-click issue. There's been times I've bought products others said were defective and never had a problem, so I figured I would still get it. That was just gambling for quality, trying to beat the odds. Boy, is my face red. Bought at the end of April, double-clicking severely by October. Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle. Most games are unplayable. If I click once, I need it to register one click. Not two, three, or more. I contacted Logitech support, as it is under warranty. After about a week they responded with a process that almost completely would absolve them of having to follow through - jumping through hoops with steps up to and including a click testing website where you have to record video with your phone and send it to them to prove it. I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer. I'll never buy a Logitech product again. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this. You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed.<br /><br />Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings. Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow. The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem. The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on. The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it. The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly. Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it. It just stops. Very frustrating.<br /><br />Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least. You can change the little weights inside but I'll be honest, unless you're some kind of die-hard gamer playing semi-professionally I can't see any reason someone would need that. Ultimately, I give the whole thing two stars; it probably would have been four but it loses one for the multi click problem almost everyone seems to get, and another for the unbelievable burden their support places on people to discourage anyone from actually being able to get a fix or replacement under warranty. Bad business, that. Again - don't buy this. Odds are a cheap no-name brand would last longer.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH6SYC54J7IQT6ZMX5NIIGLPU3XA,1606458705157,7,True

I've bought Logitech mice for about 2 decades now and they've always done well for me until now.<br /><br />This mouse has a design flaw. You can see it in lots of other reviews here and I want to add my story to the list. I'm on my second mouse. Both were bought new. The first I bought from Amazon, the second from Target. The first mouse survived 6 months. The second survived 4. For me the failure mode has been if I hold down the left mouse button, it can randomly register multiple clicks while the button is held down. If you're trying to highlight text that means killing your selection and starting a new one. If you're moving a file it means dropping the file wherever happens to be when it decides you're not still holding the button, if you're playing a game, it can mean double spending on an attribute point or on a weapon that you hold to charge it can mean randomly shooting early.<br /><br />This problem isn't limited to the left mouse button, I've seen it happen on the right button as well where it continually flipped me in and out of sniper mode in games.<br /><br />It's a shame. I really like the mouse when it works, but a $50 mouse should last longer than 5 months (the average for my 2 mice).",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHQTG7NT34SRIHBX4ZJNGVYGSY4Q,1608869937533,0,True

The cursor control of the G502 is indeed better than all others I've tried, as is the ergonomics with one exception:  the scroll wheel.  Unlike the nicely rubberized and textured sides of the mouse, the surface of the scroll wheel is slick.  So slick, in fact, that I am unable to operate it in its normal (ratcheting) mode without licking my finger to create surface tension.  I guess I have very dry skin!  Luckily, there is a button to disengage the ratcheting mechanism, allowing the scroll wheel to spin freely.  Though I've never had a mouse with this feature before, I think I may come to prefer it.  The free spinning scroll wheel mode will enable Caucasian males to operate the G502 without needing to start moisturizing their skin.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFOPPSFOUQYYXHY7HJZP7NPZJXLA,1650176765874,0,True

3.0,thumb rest is horrid.,"My biggest gripe is that stupid thumb rest on the side. I've always gotten myself a cheap mouse and i've always had them for years. The only reason i got this mouse was because i read good reviews on the scroll wheel. All of my mice have had scroll wheel issues so i took it upon myself to get something nice for myself. Nah. I will be returning this tomorrow. The scroll wheel is fantastic so far but this thing is horrible to pick up. It's like trying to grip a shape with two sloped inward sides. There's no grip. Seems like every button on here was intended for changing the DPI settings. I went into the software and disabled every single button other than the left, right and scroll click.

Issues I've had include losing profiles, not switching profiles, hanging on firmware updates, graphical problems in the software, crashes, and just a general terrible UI and UX design. Don't count on future updates fixing the software either as I've had this mouse for over a year and it's a crapshoot whether a software update will make things worse or not.<br /><br />So yeah.

Profiles can be made for different games and applications. DPI display (3 bars of light) allow easy checking of DPI. Mouse can be tuned any way you want.<br /><br />The bad: G-Hub sucks, but is necessary for most of the mouse's functions.

4.0,Easy to set up programmable keys,"I've had this mouse now for about 3 weeks.<br /><br />This is the first programmable mouse I've ever bought. I was very iffy at first because there are so many buttons on most programable mouses so I wanted something that was simple but yet effective for low-end gaming. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I was able to program keys to the mouse via their software which didn't take very long to download. I just keep the program up at all times and If I feel like changing a button I can do so in less than 15 seconds. You could also close the program and open from your desktop in seconds. I have smaller hands for a guy but the mouse still feels great. If my hands were a little bit larger it would be perfect.<br /><br />I haven't had any mechanical issues. All the buttons work well (no double clicking). I love the feature of the mouse wheel where if you push the button in below the wheel, it either opens fully or restricts slightly the motion of the wheel. Basically, the one motion is like that of a normal mouse wheel and the other motion scrolls nearly indefinitely depending how fast you spin the wheel. It's really cool.<br /><br />I noticed that compared to any standard mouse I've ever used, my precision and accuracy of mouse movements has been greatly increased when using this mouse. I noticed this especially while gaming.<br /><br />I haven't messed around with the weights, but you can add/remove weights to make the mouse heavier/lighter. I'm just not interested in that and adapted to the default from delivery.<br /><br />The lighting options on the mouse are cool but that's just supplemental. It's everything else about the mouse that I like. I mean, we don't really look at our hand while we are on the computer much do we lol.<br /><br />Overall, It's a great mouse. I was worried about double-clicking that I read in some other reviews, but I haven't noticed that.

1.0,2nd logitec Mouse that has left click issues,"I don't often play click heavy games like shooters. I mostly play RPG's, Strategy games, or I use my controller, and I regularly using this mouse for general computing. However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did. Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure. Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked.<br /><br />Compounding this issue is my long standing loyalty to this company. I have a Logitech G213 Keyboard, a G935 headset with all the LED's synced, and I have a set of Logitech speakers on my desk that are 15 years old that sound great and still rumble the windows when the bass hits. Even though the last mouse failed, I still bought another, thinking this time would be different. I've been using Logitec products and recommended them to others for years (I work in IT), so It doesn't make me happy that these mice keep failing on me from the company that I love. Seeing as other people are having these issues, I'm never wanting to get another one of these gaming mice again. Might have to start transitioning all my gear to another company soon too.

Second the thumb rest is lifted from the bottom of where the little plastic plate is to hold in the weights, and it creates long sharp bump on the edge of the rest that is very very annoying to feel. So I refunded it (Which took me so long to repackage because of how the wire goes in) and got another one. Mouse had the same thing which my other g502 didnt have and my 2 other friends dont have and its very very annoying.

I've been using it for a month though so it may just take time to get used to. Kind of wish the scrollbar was smoother and quieter (it's very loud!). The horizontal scroll is nice but it is slow.

No need to get the mouse with the mousepad, just get any cheaper priced 8.5 x 11 paper sized one. Honestly, for me, the G300S is a better mouse but I couldn't find it so this was the next best thing.

2.0,Terrible software makes for an average mouse,"So, the mouse itself is pretty basic.

And trying to remove the unusable software from your PC is also a pain.<br /><br />Another thing, the mouse wheel glides a bit TOO well. I'll be playing a game, and if I move my mouse a certain way, the wheel moves and cycles through my hot bar. It's also a pain when you're just browsing the internet and you want to scroll down a little, and it sends you to the bottom of the page.<br /><br />Honestly, don't buy this unless it's on sale, or until Logitech gets their s*** together.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AE4ZKQ6DAO5XARJL3UQGADVXTFGQ,1620201039468,0,True

5.0,Perfect All-Round,"This mouse is probably the best mouse I've had in a long time. In the past, I've owned a Magic Eagle mouse, a Razor DeathAdder 2.0 (and many more) and this is by far the best mouse I've purchased.<br /><br />Compared to other gaming mice, this mouse has optional additional weight. This is quite nice because I can add as much weight as I'm comfortable with or no weight at all and be happy with how smoothly my mouse moves. This is perfect when it comes to matching movement and DPI settings both.<br /><br />Another cool feature is the scroll wheel actually has a 'lock' on it. You can scroll with it and it'll scroll normally OR you can 'unlock it' and when you scroll, the scroll wheel can keep spinning endlessly which makes it so easy to quickly scroll down a page or multiple pages. Quite a unique idea!<br /><br />My favorite part is how you can customize the DPI settings in the Logitech GHub Application. It's useful to modify all your different DPI levels (which you can control with the click of a button on the side of the mouse) to have different settings if you have a different use for the mouse with specific situations. It's quite nice to be able to switch DPI levels with just the help of one click of a button.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very high quality mouse with a very unique design and overall performance. I highly recommend it for gamers but it doesn't hurt to use for general use either such as work or school, it's really your choice. It's a very nice mouse.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH4A3OQIHHDNUYWZPZXEMRYZBGSA,1648203612773,0,True

You have to mash down hard with your index finger (or thumb) in order to use it as your third button, and you have to mash down and push hard with your index finger to turn the wheel (when not in free-spin mode).

This mouse has a specific button near the thumb to reduce the DPI to the lowest setting only while your thumb is pressing it, thus dubbing it the 'sniper button'.

Took me a couple days to get used to the new button layout, as I have been using the Razer Mamba for about 9 months now.  I can add weights, making it feel more solid. I can already tell this mouse is going to be amazing, just also switched to the Logitech G533 too from the Razer Kraken as a larger overall switch from Razer to Logitech (Price and Quality is simply more worth it with Logitech as in the same price will get you more quality with Logitech).

To their credit, they were able to quickly send me a replacement with very little fuss.<br /><br />Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely. I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable. They know these switches are bad. Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements.<br /><br />If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone.

I didn't expect to like it as much as I do but after using it at home for months I had to get one to use at work because a standard office mouse just isn't cutting it.

2.0,Programming issues w/ onboard memory,"I've had this mouse for over two years and finally had to write a review after the software updates only provided a modicum of relief to the issues I've had. This mouse has a major flaw that will keep users from truly enjoying how good this mouse really is.<br /><br />To whit: the onboard memory programming is a pain in the ass, doesn't enable all of the features, and is generally unfriendly. Rather than having an interface where you can set settings in the onboard memory directly, you must turn off the onboard memory, modify a profile, then load that profile into memory when you reenable it.<br /><br />If you don't use the onboard memory, the mouse reverts to its lowest (slowest) possible setting until the software loads. That's normally annoying but fine if you have a fast computer, but any time the software experiences *any* issues, such as updating, the mouse is stuck in stupid mode until its finished. I've also had the software crash on me several times (unrelated issues) and having my otherwise very nice mouse turn into a rage-inducing slug is not at all helpful.<br /><br />In short, you either A) use the onboard memory and sacrifice all of the flexibility and fancy options that having a 'smart' mouse enables or B) have to deal with a sluggish, frustrating mouse every time you restart your computer or the software stops working (for whatever reason).<br /><br />If I had known it had these issues, despite being generally satisfied, I would not have bought it. The flashy lighting and togglable scroll wheel (which I have to admit is awesome) is not worth the frustration every time my computer boots up. I literally avoid using my mouse until I'm certain the software is started because the experience of having my mouse move at 20% of its normal speed is so jarring.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AG2QK3RJG5YXRNTUKCAFRJXPV7HA,1662048142141,0,False
1.0,"After 6mo of mostly desktop use, can't click and drag any more. Worthless crap.","After about 6mo of mostly desktop use (office, email, text editing) and a few dozen hours of gaming, the left mouse button's switch is broken. It registers clicks, but if you try to click and hold it acts like you're clicking like mad instead--some sort of electrical connectivity problem. Logitech pushed a firmware update to ""update click debouncing algorithm"" (technical term for this sort of issue) last month, and it helped--for all of two weeks. Now it's worse than before. Searching around online reveals this is apparently a widespread issue with Logitech gaming mice. Wish I'd known that before I bought. Decades of &lt;$20 crap mice and this is the first time I've seen this problem--apparently Logitech is not the brand it once was.

2.0,Double-click flaw effectively kills the mouse.,"I purchased my G502 back in March, when it looked like I'd be working from home a lot more. I needed a new mouse, and I game a lot, so my research led me to the G502 Hero. I was very happy with it for the first three months; customizable buttons using the Logitech software was a breeze, and I loved the feel of the device.<br /><br />Then, after four months of daily use, I noticed the mouse was double-clicking by itself sometimes. Other times, the mouse would release a click while I was trying to drag something, which led to a lot of misplaced files, and unintended highlighting of text. There is no rhyme or reason as to when these events happen, or in what application - it just randomly happens. I'm very unhappy with the quality of the hardware here, despite the device's many positive aspects. Since I'm already past Amazon's return cutoff, I'm going to have to file a warranty claim with Logitech, so that should be fun.<br /><br />I'd advise buyers to avoid this mouse, because this appears to be a widespread issue.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFWZDTTFPZ3GFPNPZTK3YDOZNM7A,1598152155177,0,True

The software is a bit weird, though, as I wanted to bind my shift and left control to the G5 and G4 buttons for Valorant, but it wouldn't let me. To get around this, you can bind a command so I just did ""shift and -"" and the same for ctrl because, for whatever reason, that worked. Now i can crouch spam in Valorant easier than before.

But that’s just me, I know someone with the wireless version of this model and it works just as great. I love the fact that you can change the weight of the mouse with the included weight kit that it comes with. I personally use it in the lightest form but there is a lot of options for those that would like it a bit heavier. The added buttons are nice for gaming and overall navigation of the pc and the Logitech software used with this product is easy to work with. Also, the rgb for this mouse isn’t a lot but the customization for it is pretty nice. I’ve had many moments of appreciation so far when I look at my setup because this mouse really just brings it all together and makes for a really nice design.

It often does not load on startup correctly, or it will stop working at some point and requires a computer restart, or it will randomly default the extra buttons back to changing the mouse sensitivity. It's incredibly frustrating that pressing a button has a chance of doing something totally different than what you expect.<br /><br />Over the past two years, I've seen no meaningful improvements to the G HUB software on either operating system.

I'm not sure why it died so quickly.<br /><br /> I bought the second when my Razer died last week. It was the best one available at a local Office Depot & I needed it ASAP.  It was only about $10 more than a regular mouse. It's much more comfortable and responsive than a regular mouse and I like being able to customize it. I have a movement disorder and sometimes I need to have it be much less responsive to my hand movements. It works pretty well for that (better than most mice), then on good days I can set the DPI to high. The heaviness of the mouse is a plus w my movement disorder. You can add or take out weights if you want a heavier or lighter mouse.<br /><br />Love it! Hope this one lasts longer.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGWWCK4U4SPSMGDCXPG6NSR2DDHA,1606765213741,0,False

4.0,Not horrible,"Bought this mouse because my last razer one got crushed when I was moving. This mouse is not too bad, but as someone with large hands, there are some things I do not like. Firstly, it is a little small. Probably not an issue for most people. I suppose it is an average sized mouse, but for fast paced shooter games, having a small mouse with several buttons on it can be conflicting (at least for me). Secondly, the scroll wheel does not ""notch"" if that makes sense. Most mice have a notched scroll wheel, this one does not. It rolls smoothly and feels nice, but in games I never really know how far I need to scroll to get to another item or piece of equipment (you know what I mean.) It is very easy to scroll too far or not enough, so I end up just using the number line on the keyboard to switch items.

3.0,Not the best fit for my long salad fingers.,"I bought this mouse about two weeks ago. I can’t say I recommend it for larger hands / longer fingers. I often misclick the DPI shift button (big square one on the left side) and DPI button left of the left click. The buttons feel cramped around my thumb, and I’ve tried every grip - palm, claw, fingertip, or any other improvised grip - I can for this thing to try and remedy this, to no avail.<br /><br />The wheel’s locking/unlocking button is great for either browsing or gaming. There are many who state the wheel gets worse after not-so-heavy use, so be wary.<br /><br />I love the accuracy of the laser - it’s great for pinpoint accuracy in FPS aiming. The mouse does move well though the wheel does shake annoyingly when snapping left or right.<br /><br />My biggest problem I haven’t seen in reviews is how the G Hub software for setting mouse sensitivity/lighting was very fussy with me. It crashes every now and then when trying to set anything.<br /><br />Overall this mouse was a disappointment simply due to my large hands. I’d recommend the g502 Hero for those with smaller hands who enjoy heavier mice.

3.0,Decent at $40 (Beware of the weights,"After 2 Corsair M65 Pro's getting double click issues within 4 years, I decided to give Logitech a shot when I saw this on sale for 40 bucks. I'll start with I like how it feels in my hand and the 2 extra buttons are really nice to have. The build quality is ok, the plastic is generally thin and feels kind of cheap. Doesn't have the same quality feel as the M65 which is at the same price point. I always have loved Logitech scroll wheels and the infinity scroll is amazing for work.<br /><br />I am also glad they included the weights. That being said, after you put the weights in, the bottom panel of the mouse doesn't really close all the way since all they have to ""latch"" it shut is a fairly weak magnet (aka cheap) This causes the mouse to wiggle laterally a bit when clicking or moving the mouse. Honestly, I just fixed this with some of the thin double-sided clear 3m adhesive. Unfortunately, this caused issue #2. I am not sure you would have this issue on a cloth mouse pad so take it with a grain of salt since I use one of the hard corsair mousepads, but since the bottom part of the mouse didn't fully sit down with the weights, it wasn't flush and the mouse was gliding on that piece of plastic instead of the smooth pads. This probably wouldn't be an issue if they didn't cover that whole panel of plastic in a mosaic of triangle bumps that collect all kinds of gunk (if you use a hard mouse pad, you'll know what I mean) which makes the mouse sort of sticky and you have to put a little extra effort into getting the mouse to move, making minor adjustments like closing a window sort of annoying. After having to clean it with a toothpick every 3 or 4 days, I fixed this by sanding the entire bottom pad down with various grits of sandpaper till it was nice and smooth. I probably wouldn't have had these issues if not for the weights but don't include them if they cause all sorts of issues.<br /><br />The last thing I will comment on is the software. TL;DR, its not good. It doesn't recognize all your games to make profiles. It's not always clear which profile you are editing and the default profile doesn't persist after loading it onto the mouse when I move over to Ubuntu (which my corsair did). I've also had issues with it changing what it thinks the default DPI should be for a profile and I don't see a way to set that (you could in Corsairs software)<br /><br />At 50 bucks I can tolerate all these faults, its not terrible or unusable by any means. I would have definitely returned it at full price and honestly, the Corsair software is so much better that I can't recommend a higher end model since you'd still have to deal with it even though the 2 extra buttons are nice, a few times its just been too much of a pain to remap them so if the game doesn't recognize them, you're screwed anyways and they might as well not be there.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AEWTDKL4QT4CKI6CCN6WIT2YQJ7A,1652222879100,0,False

3.0,Right Mouse Button Issue,"In a lot of ways I really like this mouse.  It feels good, the button placements are decent and it controls well.  My last three have been of this model.<br /><br />The problem is those have all come within the span of about 2 years because of the same issue:  After a few months the right mouse button never wants to stay clicked.  Every other button works fine, but the RMB always develops a problem.  And this same exact thing has happened with every G502 I've owned.<br /><br />This is a known issue with the mouse.  Which might be fine if it was one of the other buttons, but the RMB is a primary button on most any mouse so the fact that it has problem so soon is kind of a big deal.  I know this is a cheaper gaming mouse, but I've had real cheap generic computer mice (the $10 sort) that have lasted for years without a single issue.

Both have suffered the double - click ""kiss of death"", where a single left click is registered as two clicks, making it unusable. This is caused by cheap Omron switches, undoubtedly chosen by Logitech to save money.<br /><br />Your mouse WILL eventually face the same issue, and you'll either have to buy another one, or attempt to replace the switches, which requires de-soldering and re-soldering new switches. If it's your first time doing that, you run the risk of making your problems worse instead of better. The middle prong on the switches is particularly difficult to disconnect without damaging the board.<br /><br />Putting all that aside, I love this mouse. Ergonomically, functionally, it's unbeatable. Combined with useful software that allows you to customize button-mappings to your heart's content.<br /><br />My only wish is that Logitech would use Kailh switches and ditch the cheap Onron ones.<br /><br />I would recommend the G502 with the caveat that it will expire faster than it should, and you'll either have to buy another mouse, or drop around $40 - $50 to repair it.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AENRG4BAYMO3S6RKN3QHXK4WC3OA,1618983449025,0,False

5.0,This mouse is very comfortable for FPS games.,"I play Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, COD WWII, Modern Warfare 2, Black OPS 4 and this mouse is very comfortable. Many complain that this mouse is heavy, but it doesn't feel heavy to me. I guess it all comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />This mouse has on-board memory, which let's you save your configuration into it. This is nice, since I don't want to always run the Logitech software, and it's good for when you use this mouse on another computer and don't have the software there.<br /><br />Anyways, I only created one profile with it and I have my lowest DPI to 400. That's what I use for FPS games. Then I set another DPI to 1200, which I use for when I am browsing the Internet. With this mouse, it's so easy to change DPI with the DPI buttons. Since my DPI is already set, I am free to delete the Logitech software.<br /><br />If you are gaming on a Linux computer, you can always set your mouse settings through a Windows PC or a Virtual Machine. It's a plus that it has on-board memory.<br /><br />The side buttons are very tactile and feel really solid. Also, the left and right mouse click buttons have very low travel time and feel very responsive.<br /><br />I got big hands and play claw style.

G4 button near the thumb is easy to mis-click (which by default is page back).

2.0,Works but design is poor,"I got this to attempt to replace my wonderful, but old and failing, Logitech G700s mouse.<br /><br />It has fewer buttons and they are arranged differently from the 700s model.  I use it for productivity and not gaming, so the buttons are for copying, deleting and moving around web pages.  The 2 by 2 side buttons of the G700s are perfect for my hand and the left top row of buttons is perfect for page up and down scrolling.  This G520 has three side buttons instead of four which are spaced in an ""L"" shape instead of a rectangle of two and two.  It has the same three top, left edge buttons, but they are spaced further apart with less tactile feel.<br /><br />This model suffers from a design or manufacturing flaw.<br /><br />It has a replaceable bottom plate that covers a recessed area where you can install thin pieces of metal to change the weight of the mouse.  The design or manufacture of this unit made the bottom plate sit higher than the rest of the mouse.  So when you press one of the main buttons, the mouse rocks forward and then back.  That causes the laser tracker to move your cursor.  So you point and click, but the mouse moves the cursor a little, so you miss your target.  Removing and keeping the bottom plate off allows the mouse to work just fine.  The weights are friction fit, so they stay in place.  I'm afraid to bump the mouse too hard, though, as that might dislodge one or more of the weights.<br /><br />The Logitech Gaming Software works well enough but is not intuitive or easy to master for productivity.  It seems the manufacturers of mice aren't aware that multi-button mice are being used for productivity as well as gaming.<br /><br />I marked it down one star for the software and button arrangement, and down two more stars for the bottom plate defect.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFJR6RVS4MILOZGTXI6ODGHBX6RQ,1638272301919,0,True

Having those shortcuts on the mouse is perfect if your extended fingers on your other hand can't press a specific button on the keyboard.<br /><br />Minor issues to keep in mind, it has a lot of open edges/corners that can collect dust and dead skin cells.

4.0,Hands down the best mouse for the price,"I bought this on Best Buy due to long shipping wait times but felt I needed to give my opinion on the G502 hero. This for the price of $40 at the time of writing is hands down the best mouse you can buy at this price point.<br /><br />PROS<br />- The sensor on this thing is really awesome. It can handle high DPIs without seeming like a mess. I tried going at it's max which is 16,000 DPI and it actually was somewhat movable which is amazing.<br />- The buttons are really tactile, sturdy, and can be spammed easily without it feeling weird.<br />- The scroll wheel can have it's drag turned on and off which is awesome and even doubles as a fidget spinner.<br />- The weight of the mouse can be changed with the included weights.<br />- The braided cable can be easily slid across the table without drag.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Macros are set within the mouse's memory which is great. Except the fact that I can't set multiple key macros for one button in the software. For instance I can't make one button press alt + A for me. It has to either be alt or A.<br />- The mouse has a middle button below the scroll wheel drag button that is really oddly placed. I have to reach for this if I want to use it which sucks.<br /><br />Overall, for this price, there is a lot to like here. Logitech has been in the mouse business for years and the G502 hero shows that they are still hands down the best when it comes to the mouse. I highly recommend you snag this limited time deal as this mouse is unlike any other mouse at this price point.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGMW3CHMBC5YSAFGFUFIJ4I3WSIQ,1607278741431,1,False

5.0,Really well made mouse. Logitech did it!,"This review is for the Hero version of G502. I have stopped using Logitech mice since they discontinued G9. I have been using Roccat Kone XTD since then that died after serving me for over 5 years. After reading reviews about G502 I decided to give it a try as I really liked the overall design and feel , it reminded me of G9.<br /><br />So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one. Now that I used it I am glad I did. The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502. Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner. However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable.<br /><br />While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators . The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism. Last but not least is the scroll wheel. This... this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is... Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL. Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way. I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502. You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFLBVSNSY7YV3A7CEJCHDVCZXPSA,1539014934066,85,True

I prefer a palm grip but will sometimes use a claw grip and holding the mouse is comfortable either way. The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights. The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around. I'd say the only issues I've had so far have been getting the cable trained to lay how I want it and acclimating to the scroll wheel being a smooth metal surface rather than rubberized. Coming from a G500s, I miss the rubberized scroll wheel but not enough for this to be a major issue for me now that I'm used to the smoother metal. The cable takes a few days to fully train, depending on what shape it needs to be. Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard. Within a week, I had the cable situated mostly how I wanted it.<br /><br />Gaming and general usage so far have been great. The range of DPI settings mean I can set exactly the speed I want and the DPI switching buttons are great for people who prefer having a few options for movement and aiming.

2.0,FAILED AMAZON SERVICE AND 2 DEFECTIVE ITEMS- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.,"Don't waste your time or money. After a couple of months of use, this mouse wouldn't function properly, the pointer is jittery and won't hold among other things.. So, I  called amazon and they first said they were going to replace it via the extra warranty I purchased, which I thought was ridiculous because it was a defective piece of merchandise. I waited but it never came. I called back again, this time Amazon said it should not have been a replacement through my Asurion policy, and said they would send me a replacement right away. I received the replacement, and after a month-not during the time of the 1st or 2nd call to them did they say I would need to return the old mouse. A month or so later, I get a email saying I needed to return the old mouse or they will charge me for the 2nd mouse, but don't send me a return label. Then they send me an email saying to drop it off at a Kohls store-no box needed. I am a handicapped person that lives on the 2nd floor in the apartment complex. I do not have transportation and do not go out. That's why I have Amazon Prime - for the delivery feature. They just charged me $57 for the 2nd mouse and guess what? The 2nd mouse is doing the same malfunctions as the first!  Needless to say, I won't buy this brand again and Amazon has definitely FAILED in its service through this whole process. I purchase weekly through Amazon and don't believe that I or anyone else should be treated this way. Now, I have to make a third time-consuming call that will aggravate me and make me ill.  AMAZON, IF YOU'RE READING THIS-AS YOU SHOULD BE-SEND ME A RETURN SLIP AND I WILL SEND BOTH OF THE DEFECTIVE MOUSES BACK.

5.0,Same feel as Proteus. base cover from Proteus fits. Thinner lighter cable.,"My Proteus crapped out on me after 4 years of excellent service, so I grabbed this to replace it.<br /><br />It has the exact same feel as the Proteus. Its still heavy, you won't be walking into any FPS league championships with it. But you can stay competitive. I don't know why they still bother with the weights, like it needs to be any heavier. Other games won't be hindered by the weight.<br /><br /> The base weight cover has a black lip unlike the Proteus's teal lip, but you can use the base cover from the Proteus  on the Hero, transferring that blue aesthetic. So you can make this look nearly identical to the Proteus. I didn't think I'd care for the RGB as It tends to be dimmer than static lighting and I only want blue, but turns out I can make a better blue from it. The Proteus has a lot of green to its blue light, and its actually brighter.<br /><br />I really haven't noticed a difference with the improved sensor, I guess I'm just not pro enough to notice.<br />It feels exactly like the Proteus, exactly what I wanted.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j-2LWF3WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j-2LWF3WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j-2LWF3WL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFSOZC67YXYAJGXIFBLU376N3WYQ,1563504911486,1,True

I have been buying Logitech products since the company started in the 1980s and have owned many Logitech mice. I purchased this in October of 2019 as an upgrade to an older Logitech G700 which is no longer available. I initially liked the mouse. It has good set of features and I liked the overall design, however after a couple of months I began to have problems with intermittent operation of the right mouse button. At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events. If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning. I contacted Logitech and after troubleshooting the problem they sent me a replacement mouse. Over the last couple of weeks the replacement has begun to exhibit the same problem. A quick internet search reveals that this seems to have been a common problem with this model since its release which Logitech has not fixed despite a large number of complaints.. At this point it seems like a waste of time to request another replacement since it seems like;y that it too will fail.

The only thing I am still not sure about is if I should have gone with the wireless Lightspeed model. That is the difference between the two mice. I have the corded model. I wanted to avoid any connection problems.<br />So, this mouse is well made and nice to hold. The buttons are placed well for average hands. I cant fault them for my hands, as I have unusually large hands and fingers (my ring sizes are in the 20's and 30's). I am used to having this problem with all mice however.

4.0,UPDATE: Good Warranty; PRIOR: Faulty Mouse Died After Two Months,"Update: My prior Chinese manufactured G502 Hero died on me after I dropped it a few too many times. Took about a year and several drops from standard table height.<br /><br />If you are boycotting China products, then you'll be happy to know that the G502 is now being manufactured in Malaysia.<br /><br />Update: The entire process took about 14 days, but I did receive a replacement mouse under the two-year warranty for the item. I am not sure what happened to my prior mouse; it could have been used as I didn't inspect it closely for fingerprint smudges or tampering. Make sure that you do your due diligence regarding that inspection.<br /><br />Ultimately, Logitech did the right thing and sent me a new mouse under the warranty program. Other than the failure of the prior G502 Mouse I had purchased, this mouse is the best I have used to this date. I hope it doesn't spontaneously burn out after the warranty period ends.<br /><br />This mouse was fantastic. The key word is: was. After owning this mouse for a total of two months, it is no longer fantastic. The mouse died on me without explanation. There is no conceivable reason for it having done so. It just suddenly connected and disconnected to my PC randomly before refusing to connect or power on ever again.<br /><br />I tried multiple USB ports. I tried everything. Other mouses work. This one does not work anymore. And, unfortunately, it died before I could return it.<br /><br />Here is a description of exactly what happened and my diagnostic attempts to correct the problem: ""The mouse suddenly and inexplicably began intermittently turning on and off disconnecting and reconnecting from my PC. The lights on the mouse were erratic and not working properly. The mouse connected for a few minutes but the laser tracker was not functioning on the bottom of the mouse. It would not work. I tried all the USB ports. None worked for the mouse. I tried a new mouse. The new mouse worked perfectly fine in the same USB ports. The problem was with the G502 Hero mouse that suddenly died after I unplugged it the first time to try another port. It never turned on again and remained disconnected. Something short-circuited inside the mouse; it is a hardware issue.""<br /><br />I will update this review should Logitech do the right thing and make good on their warranty.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916mHzMHgKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916mHzMHgKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916mHzMHgKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHKERBEJXPVNJRQEYMTOTAEIV72Q,1558151640793,0,True

Without a wrist pad raising up your wrist this mouse will work okay.<br /><br />CON # 2: The scroll wheel is a very smooth metal surface.

3.0,A Solid Every Day & Part Time Gaming Mouse (Update:  Failed at 29 days & Again @ 16 months),"I am unfortunately replacing a mouse I really liked, the Corsair M65, which suffered from a way too early failure.  I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand.  Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel.  This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights.  I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch.  This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair.  The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired.  It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming.  Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars.<br /><br />Update:  I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab.  The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use.  Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window.  Mice have been around for a long time and the tech to make them reliable has also been around for a long time.  Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase.  I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one.  At least they work reliably for a good long time.  This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade.<br /><br />Update 2:  The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit.  I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area.  When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there.  Not super inconvenient, but also not a ""feature"" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years.<br /><br />Update 3:  Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star.  I'm done with these expensive mice.  I've had mice last 10+ years, but can't get a single ""high-end gaming mouse"" to last even 2 years.  I'm either the unluckiest guy ever, or I suspect these are just a cash grab.  $13 off brand mouse it is.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFGSNMNNS4YW7M4JDAMQAWLIPMBA,1570334317007,7,True

5.0,Big improvement over older generation gaming mouse.,"I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change.  So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM.  My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates.  Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky.  This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning.  So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:<br />1. Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games.  At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse.  The main thing you are really after is turning off ""mouse acceleration"".  The difference in smoothness is night and day.  I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters.  With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do.<br /><br />2. Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces.  My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction.  This mouse can do it, so problem solved.<br /><br />3. This mouse allows balancing with weights.  I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice.  The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right.<br /><br />For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:<br />1. Setup under Windows.  The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate.<br /><br />2. In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration.  Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf<br />and enter in the following:<br />Section ""InputClass""<br />  Identifier ""My Mouse""<br />  Driver ""libinput""<br />  MatchIsPointer ""yes""<br />  Option ""AccelProfile"" ""flat""<br />  Option ""AccelSpeed"" ""0""<br />EndSection<br /><br />3. Restart your X server by logging out and back in.<br /><br />4. Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy!  The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games.  Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right?<br /><br />As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots.  Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now.<br /><br />While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement.  I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS.

1.0,"Nice features, but ultimately uncomfortable","When I got the mouse, I figured it would just take some period of adjustment. Well here I am, outside of the return window, still not ""adjusted' to the mouse's shape and size.<br /><br />The mouse is just too small, I don't have particularly big hands, if anything they're average sized. I cannot find a comfortable grip of this mouse. When I place my hand how it most naturally fits on the mouse, the extra buttons are out of reach. When I put my whole hand on the mouse (so that the top of my palm touches), my fingers extend over the extra buttons so I have to awkwardly press them with my joints.<br /><br />The profile feature of the mouse is nice, with different sets of DPI adjustments for switching between shooters and casual browsing. The mouse is mechanically nice, the buttons feel good and don't feel cheap, but the shape of the mouse is wrong.<br /><br />Ultimately what I'm looking for in a mouse  is comfort during use and I did not find it here.

5.0,Just as good as the original,"I bought a G502 years ago, when the line first launched, and I loved it. I used it for hours each day for those years, and I never regretted that purchase. However, a few weeks ago the left mouse button started double clicking. I tried it with different computers and reset the settings on the mouse but nothing fixed it. It seems the switch is dying. I considered repairing it (and I still might), but the cost of parts is about 1/3 of a new mouse and I would also need something more advanced than the Radio Shack soldering iron I have somewhere in a drawer. So I bought the new G502 Hero. It is every bit as good as the original. In fact, they are practically the same mouse from the outside. The blue accents are gone from the original, and the logo is different, but otherwise they are identical. Of course, the sensor on the Hero is different, having a higher DPI range and requiring less power, but I haven't noticed a difference in my usage, because I typically stay between 1600 and 8000 DPI anyway. My only complaint in all of this is the software. I really wish there was a way to export settings from one mouse and import them to another, especially two mice which are so similar.

3.0,Uneven left mouse button,"The key features to note about this product that may make this the wrong choice for you are as follows:<br />1.) The odd shape and size of the mouse. This mouse is quite large and has a contour on the right side that can cause your hand to slide off. I personally like the size because I have medium size hands but like to rest my palm far back on the mouse with a palm grip. I don't care for the contour however because it causes my hand to slide to that side and doesn't support my fingers over there. That can cause my thumb to rub up against the buttons on the right side uncomfortably.<br />2.) The buttons on this mouse are somewhat looser than your standard mouse. By this I mean they have less resistance to pressing and tend to wiggle more. This mainly applies to the two main mouse buttons and the scroll wheel. I'm used to using mice like this, but for those who aren't it can take some adjusting to get used to it.<br />3.) Another concern is (although it may not be the case in every mouse) the build quality. When I originally received my mouse, the left mouse button was setting slightly lower than the other buttons. This doesn't cause a functionality issue, but it causes my index finger to rub up along the ridge in between the dpi buttons and the left mouse button.<br /><br />There are plenty of great features I noticed about this product, but I thought I would point out some of the features that aren't necessarily bad but may turn some people away.<br /><br />Update after about 8 months of use:<br />The pads at the bottom of the mouse tend to slide around a little bit which causes the resin that holds them to the bottom of the mouse to come out from under the pads. This is annoying because it tends to get on my mouse pad and also collects a lot of dust around the pad (which is hard to clean) where the resin is exposed.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGCLAP3XC37WWDJQ3RJBZAIC5TZA,1563848179256,0,True

1.0,Right click doesn't hold. Keeps double clicking,"Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1. I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues. I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews.

3.0,LOVE the G502's (owned multiple) BUT that middle mouse click on this HERO version :-( **EDITED**,"First off, I'm biased.  I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years.  Bought back when they were in the $100 range.  Loved the mouse.  So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged.  Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme.  Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version.  Weird.<br /><br />Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way.  Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing.  Oh well.  I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine.<br /><br />**EDIT** 12/25/19<br />Have to send this back for a replacement.  The mouse wheel buttons are defective.  If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly).  The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch.  They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button.  Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502.  My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use.<br /><br />**EDIT** 12/27/19<br />First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly!  Great customer service.  Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem.  You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously.  I hope I am explaining this right.  I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right.  I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well.  I've decided to keep the mouse because its still a great everyday driver but for a gaming mouse, I wouldn't recommended it if you like to use the middle mouse click.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AH22EBG2F2OTXUYFILOIVVWZTROA,1577148809900,1,True

The mouse has more sensitivity, RGB and button customization than I'll probably ever need and then there are those weights...<br /><br />Now this mouse is heavy, so, that's something I didn't give much thought about before, if that's something important to you, think it twice, but for me personally it feels great in my hand.

4.0,"Great product, worth every penny!","Just got this yesterday so only had a small time to use it but must say its really great. There are some good and some bad which I will get into in a moment.  When I got it my first impressions where ""wow this box is small"" so was a bit weirded out by it thinking I either got a wrong version of it or maybe it was going to be a tiny mouse but it was the actually correct size for my hand. First time having it in my hand it felt right at home. Even better the clicking is more accurate in games with minimal effort in comparison to my old mouse which was Corsair M65 Pro. The scroll wheel broke on the M65 so was tied between M65 Elite or this and it got me thinking ""well if the original M65 has scroll wheel issue the Elite might do the same"" so with all the praise I decided to get this over the M65 Elite. So glad I did. Now onto pros and cons.<br /><br />PRO:<br />Comfortable<br />Easy to use<br />1 by 1 DPI in software<br />Many buttons/button placements.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Mistakenly hitting the sniper button. It takes little to no effort to activate it, so when I'm clicking left my thumb naturally hits it due to placement.<br /><br />It's very impressive that the mistaken clicks are my only complaint right now. Of course ill update this if anything else occurs. I would recommend this product.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/30/19: Had it for a few months i think but now it's causing an issue. Random double clicks when i try to hold down and drag something on my screen, noticed it when i was playing a game, caused my character to drop it on the ground instead of move it.

3.0,Not good for large hands,"Context: I have larger hands (19cm ring-to-wrist) and have used a g602 for many years. I liked a lot of things about this mouse, but ended up returning it.<br /><br />The biggest problem was the scroll wheel. While it scrolled excellently, with a nice ""thunk"", the side scroll was far too sensitive. Every time I clicked the wheel down (to middle-click), the mouse also registered a left scroll. Reading online suggests that this is 20% how you hold the mouse and 80% luck if you get one with a wheel on the stiffer side. I tried for a few hours to train myself how to middle-click but ended up just unbinding the left and right scroll.<br /><br />This mouse is smaller than a g602, so I have to use claw grip to hold it. However, the thumb buttons are seated pretty far forward, which means that I can either reach them or control the mouse, but not both. The mouse height is lower than my g602, so ""choking up"" on the grip and palming it just makes my whole hand contort to fit.<br /><br />If you have hands around 16.5cm I think that's probably the sweet spot.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFD7OO244LGUPQ7ETEWFUITS7IYQ,1561593173314,0,False

3.0,"Poor Mouse Wheel ""Feel""","I read through some of the user reviews and watched some video reviews on this before I purchased.  I've owned many Logitech high-end gaming mice (and general Logitech mice) in the past.  When my G700S of old was having double-click issues, I bought a Roccat Nyth.  The bigger and wider nature of the mouse took a little getting used to (with the wide right-side grip on).  I fell in love with the width and generally larger size to fit my larger hands.  However, it has built up its share of dirt and grime in rather hard to reach places in the years I've owned it.  The interchangeable and customizable thumb buttons are a very nice feature, except for the fact that the blank covers wobble detracting from the otherwise solid feel of the mouse.<br /><br />I figured I'd give Logitech another try bearing in mind the biggest nagging drawback to my old G700S was the wobbly and loud scroll wheel.  My Nyth has a tactile bumpy scroll wheel that have grown to love a lot and its quiet.  The G502 Hero's is not quiet and it is still wobbly, just like my old G700S of old.  In fact the only Logitech gaming mouse from past experience that didn't have a wobbly scroll wheel was the G7.  The scroll wheel on the Hero is not only wobbly, but the tactile actuation force difference between left tilt and right tilt is significant.  In that right tilt is so easy to accidentally hit whereas left tilt requires quite a bit more force to actuate.  This scroll wheel feel has been mostly the same throughout the various mice Logitech has made that have featured a hyperscroll wheel (you click a switch to switch between smooth scrolling and notched scrolling).  I guess in the intervening 3 years since I've owned a Logitech gaming mouse, this has not changed.  Their mouse wheel is still the same wobbly protrusion.<br /><br />Sadly, the scroll wheel tactility and overall polish (or lack thereof) is enough for me to decide to return it after only just picking this up from the Amazon locker only an hour ago.  Well that and the lack of any additional grips, though I won't hold the grip against it.  The Nyth's interchangeable grips are featured in very few mice.<br /><br />For the $75 that this mouse was, I feel the mouse wheel could have been improved considering that they've had this mouse wheel hyperscroll feature for nearly 10 years now...<br /><br />Going to give the Roccat Leadr a try considering how much i like my Nyth.  If only the Nyth came in a wireless variant with more solid (less wobbly thumb buttons and covers/spacers).<br /><br />TLDR: -2 stars for wobbling scroll wheel.  Right tilt too easy to trigger.  Wheel scrolling in notched mode is very loud, as loud as my Kaihl brown keyboard switches.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGRXEHGTORCMWWANUVCFOI2D6KCQ,1547178307129,1,True

5.0,Intended for FPS Gamers,"This product have a really nice design, I like the quality they used on it, this mouse have a lot of programmable buttons. What's also nice about this gaming mouse is that there's weights you can add and or remove. That's something unique specifically for this mouse because there's not really a lot of mouses out there that can do that. So you can change this mouse whether you like to feel a bit of heavy, or if you want it to be really light. There is this one feature on the side of the mouse, it basically changes the DPI speed when you press and hold on it, which also counts as a programmable button by the way, that button might be problematic as you might click it with your thumb on accident.

All in all it's a great mouse, built well, look good.....<br /><br />However there are a few things I want to point out.<br /><br />First the mouse wheel is metal with no rubber ""Grip"" like my last 2 mice.  This makes scrolling the wheel a bit uncomfortable and it FEELS like it's imprecise.<br /><br />The second thing is based on a comparison to my old Logitech MX  Master which was a  bit larger with a better surface for resting your hand.  With the MX your hand could simply rest on the mouse, supporting it almost entirely with little effort.

5.0,Good quality mouse,"Pros:<br />-Longevity: I first bought one of these mice 2 1/2 years ago, and recently the left button started feeling a little squishy. The skates should probably have been changed but they were useable. Up until that, all the buttons were pretty responsive. I used the mouse daily for work and some gaming, so the mouse averaged 50-60 hours of use per week.<br />-comfortable: took a little while to get used to the shape. My thumb didn’t exactly like the spot in between buttons but after getting used to it, it’s fine.<br />-DPI customization: you can set different DPI profiles on the mouse, and there’s a separate button to lower the DPI temporarily while pressed. This allows you to cycle quickly through different mouse sensitivities if you don’t want to fiddle with settings in every game or computer you use, and you could use the temporary button for fine movements.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the older mouse I bought had a fabric-wrapped anti-tangle cord, and the new one is just normal rubber<br />-occasionally I’ve had issues with the mouse sensor getting a little weird. Generally I cycle through the DPI profiles and this stops.<br />-takes a little while to learn how to grip the mouse without pushing buttons. I haven’t had any hand cramping issues or anything and I’ve used the mouse daily for 2.5 years.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AHK7DS2SO63HFJH52XC46RIWIDDA,1686936240325,2,True

The Clicks are nice and crisp, but the buttons DO TEND to press down when I don't want them to. The thumb buttons (Back, forward, DPI up/ down, DPI shift) are a little light and get pressed down much easier than my other mouse, Bit I just need to adjust and I'll get used to it. The infinite scroll is AMAZING, but the side clicks come with minimal force as well. Again, I just need to adjust. The mouse over all DID come with all of the things it needed to (Weights, Manual, actual mouse, etc). The weights fit in snug and show no signs of popping loose. The bottom ""Flap"" or whatever you call it, is easy to remove and place back. Wire is braided, not the lightest, but still gets the job done well, it is also very long, so you'll have no trouble reaching it to your PC without any restrictions for the most part. The software is also very useful and you can reprogram ALL of the buttons to be whatever you want them to be, and the RGB is pretty nice and vivid. The sensor is very accurate and well worth the buy.

4.0,Good mouse bad software.,I would give this mouse a perfect score if it weren't for G-hub. The application for controlling the mouse isn't very well done and has multiple issues. Otherwise the mouse is great. It's comfortable in the hands. Adjustable weights are very nice and evenly distribute the weight based on where you put them. (I have small hands and usually use a heavier mouse) I'm happy the mouse had options on it. The buttons on the mouse itself are completely programmable to the extent you can even remap left and right click to something else. (Don't know why you would unless you were running scripts for those keys but I digress.) Buttons are clicky and feel descent quality. (I use mechanical keys on my keyboard and the mouse seems to have a similar activation on it's side buttons to my otomu blue keys) The left and right click are light actuation points which is great for shooter games where who clicks first has a high degree of importance. Overall can't fault the mouse just wish the software for it were better.,[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFNZJJYWL3RJTDMUR4FSBXO37SBQ,1575442851295,0,True

I finally decided it was time to upgrade/replace, and this mouse feels amazing.  The very slidy teflon feet, which allow the G502 HERO to slide much faster than the G500s make the mouse seem faster and more responsive, even at the same DPI. The new sensor feels very snappy and precise and allows for very fine movements that the G500s wasn't as accurate at capturing.<br /><br />My only complaint is the slightly smaller overall footprint of the mouse. As a large-ish handed person I liked how the G500s filled up my whole palm, whereas the G502 falls a little short.

2.0,Most overrated gaming mouse on the market,"I've always loved Logitech products, and have used them for decades because of their quality and customer service.<br /><br />But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO. It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings. They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people.<br /><br />The main problem with this mouse is quality. It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly. There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem.<br /><br />I have 4 versions of this mouse in my house. My girlfriend has the previous non-Hero version, and that worked great for about 2 solid years of very light use before it started having issues. When you click, it double clicks. It's very frustrating and annoying.<br /><br />I built my daughter a computer a year ago, and got her the Hero. It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too. Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working. Not the typical double click problem though. Mine can't register a click+hold for long. So when you try to drag an icon on your desktop to the trash, it'll just keep dropping the icon in random places. If you try to bookmark a tab in your browser? Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab. Try to drag mail to a folder in Outlook? It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc... If you have to click+hold in a game to register an action? It won't work.<br /><br />At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse. I went to Fry's (instead of buying on Amazon this time, because I was in a hurry) and bought the exact same mouse. It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem.<br /><br />All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click. All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time. The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke. They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse. There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use. As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use. That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general. Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that. I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging. Ugh.<br /><br />On top of that, this mouse is fairly skinny and does not fit large hands very well. It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands. The Corsiars M65 was a much better fit for large hands, and is just as good as the G502 in pretty much every way except looks, and far better in terms of quality/longevity.<br /><br />As an old school Logitech fanboy, it makes me really sad to write this review.<br /><br />Don't buy this mouse. There's 10-20 other gaming mice out there that are just as good, and better quality. Look elsewhere.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AGAP7JAKV3GVQCBIUWFBUZT4V4DA,1567271634363,22,True

1.0,False/Fast double-click issue!!!,"[[VIDEOID:f23bbb57777d475d902d836be0f98c56]] Getting the mouse replaced under warranty, but not holding out hope, as this seems a common problem that gets worse with each mouse over time.<br /><br />You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both. It will be noticeable when you get false double-clicks (i.e. when you meant to single click).<br /><br />In my case, had the problem from day 1, but initially thought I was accidentally double clicking & needed to get used to the mouse's button sensitivity.  But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse. Logitech support first had me install their ""G Hub"" software and update the firmware of the mouse. This seemed to correct the problem, but only for a couple weeks. This does seem to be something that gradually deteriorates in the switch mechanism of the buttons, and a software fix can only do so much.<br /><br />There is a website that can detect the fast/false clicks.  Logitech warranty support will want a video of you using this website that detects the false/fast clicks. See video I've attached, but note they will want a handheld video where you show the physical mouse in your hand and the website on screen, no edits, etc. (this is fair--they do have to protect themselves from fraudulent warranty claims).  Google ""fast double click test"" to find the website. The problem tends to come and go, and the likelihood of getting a fast/false click may depend on exactly how you are holding the mouse at that moment, which changes as you slide the mouse around or just shift your sitting position. For the video here I happened to find a hand position where it was happening most of the time, and carefully kept my hand in that position and pressed the button the same way each time.  More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100. Sometimes I get zero out of 100.<br /><br />I'll update this review after some time with the replacement.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFXJJD7CYU45ZD665LHOEPHNWZ6Q,1575308935058,1,True

5.0,The Ultimate Gaming Mouse: Logitech G502 HERO!,"The primary purpose of the Logitech G502 HERO is to provide gamers with a high-precision tracking experience. It features Logitech's HERO (High-Efficiency Rated Optical) sensor, which is capable of tracking movement with exceptional accuracy and responsiveness. This sensor offers a wide sensitivity range of up to 16,000 DPI (dots per inch), allowing users to adjust the mouse's sensitivity to their preferences.<br /><br />I recently purchased the Logitech G502 HERO, and it has completely transformed my gaming experience. This mouse is a true game-changer, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.<br /><br />First and foremost, the tracking precision of the G502 HERO is simply unmatched. The HERO sensor's responsiveness and accuracy are outstanding, providing me with pinpoint control in every game I play. Whether I'm sniping in FPS games or executing precise movements in strategy titles, this mouse never fails to deliver.<br /><br />The customizable features of the G502 HERO are another standout aspect. With its 11 programmable buttons, I can assign specific commands or macros to each one, giving me an edge in competitive gameplay. The ability to fine-tune the mouse's sensitivity up to 16,000 DPI ensures that I can adapt it to my personal preferences, making it feel like an extension of my hand.<br /><br />The ergonomic design of the G502 HERO is a dream come true for extended gaming sessions. The textured grips provide a comfortable and secure feel, allowing me to maintain precise control without any discomfort. The inclusion of customizable weights is a fantastic touch, as I can adjust the mouse's weight and balance to suit my preferences perfectly.<br /><br />I must mention the stunning RGB lighting options that the G502 HERO offers. The customizable lighting effects add a touch of personalization and style to my gaming setup. It's a feast for the eyes and creates an immersive atmosphere while gaming.<br /><br />One feature I greatly appreciate is the onboard memory. Being able to save my settings directly on the mouse ensures that I can take my preferences with me wherever I go. It's a time-saver and makes switching between different computers hassle-free.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFDG7BAWJATBTJ5OVAU474CYDN5A,1686086659044,3,True

Extremely comfortable, and the weights you can put inside it give it a great feeling when playing. Can't use a cheap plastic mouse after having it for so long.<br /><br />Also, a minor awesome benefit I didn't notice until I broke my first trying to clean it, the M1/M2 have pressure clicks. Meaning that you can 'click' without a ton of pressure. Its difficult to describe, but apparently I had incorporated in my normal gaming without even noticing so that when I broke it, I found myself not clicking all the way.<br /><br />All of that leads to the only and massive issue. The device is INCREDIBLY difficult to keep clean. I don't have sweaty hands, but over time a steady buildup of dead skin can and will build up on the mouse wheel, left/right click and sides. This will also start to fill in the cracks between the right/left click and the wheel.

A big black square that you have to close of just to even get a hint at the menu, which has settings selection minimized.  All I wanted to do was to get the lighted logo on the mouse to stop breathing and changing color.  I would have preferred it not to even be present.  You can set this, but it's bindings break while you use the mouse and cause your gameplay to be very unstable and sometimes it will force a complete pc restart.  AVOID this gimmick.

5.0,"great mouse, upgraded from the g402","i had a deathrzor chroma which felt off, then swapped over to the g402 and felt amazing. and then again i swapped to the g502 (hero, although the difference is extremely small and you can barely tell) and it felt even better. mouse is a bit heavy even with only 1 plate (im using none) and is on the slightly large size, but i have no problem griping it even with my medium-small sized hands. software works great with it, and it feels a lot more responsive in games than other mice. its also cool to have people look at it and get confused by the alien shape. free scroll wheel is extremely satisfying and i find myself unlocking it every so often to play with it like a fidget spinner.  locked mode is quite solid. the extra button is not as convenient due to its location, but i use it to cycle through various profiles instead.<br />definitely a 5/5. the only downside i had with this mouse is that the top left 2 keys are a bit harder to reach as well as the one on the top, but i usually use them for the likes of music\volume controlls becasue the other 3 are more than enough. in addition, pressing mb3 can be quite difficult with it moving to the sides all the time, but ive gotten into the habit of using left-tilt mb3 instead, and i find it a ton more comfortable to move it to the side instead of trying to press it.",[],B07GBZ4Q68,B0BVVTQ5JP,AFZ4N4VOGTQDTMWHJRTOLPHFOFXQ,1565789737876,2,True

5.0,The Gibson (or Fender) of mice,"2nd mouse of the G502 series. Last one lasted 5 years with HEAVY USE. Precise comfortable configurable. For me wired is the way to go... the Hero wire is better than the previous one its not ""affected"" when something is touching the wire or if it is a bit tangled like the previous version occasionally ""felt"". Definitely an improvement on the original design. Got it for what $36 bucks... seriously my 1st one was $120 to $150 and I was happy to pay that.
