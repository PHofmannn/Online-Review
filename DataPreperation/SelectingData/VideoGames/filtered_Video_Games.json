Honestly I\u2019d pay the money just for Galaxy, which is my favorite Mario so far. I have fond memories of being in absolute awe when I first played it on the wii back in the day. It works well with the detached joycons to use the motion controls the way it was meant to be played.<br /><br />Mario 64 is here too, and that takes me back to the good ole days. I never did beat Mario 64 that I can recall, so looking forward to finally getting around to that.<br /><br />Mario sunshine I never played more than the intro on the GameCube. Of the 3, this is the one that excites me the least, but after I beat the other 2 I\u2019ll def give it a go. I\u2019ve played a bit and I noticed they ditched the ridiculous inverted controls, which is good for me. I\u2019m sure some people are going to be upset that there is no apparent way to switch it back.<br /><br />My major gripe, if I have to have one, is the collectible pin set that was supposed to be available to everyone that bought the game. Even though they made clear that this was a \u201cwhile supplies last\u201d kind of thing, I expected supplies to last for more than an hour.

Why did they not make this widescreen? It runs at 30fps, but somehow there are frame drops when there are more than 5 enemies on the screen. How are there frame drops in a 24 year old game? The controls are also unmappable, and they inverted them from the original.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine<br /> - Very buggy, controls inverted from the original, on screen it tells you to hit the wrong buttons (they didn't change the original text to tell you to hit the buttons that are compatible with the Nintendo switch)\u2026. Oh..... and since the switches controllers have analog triggers, you can't control water pressure. This never should have made its way to the switch in its current rushed state.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy<br /> - The joy cons are not as accurate for pointing as the Wii mote. This makes it extremely hard to collect stars, and you have to hit the recalibrate button every 10-15 seconds. Also, there is no alternative to motion controls or touchscreen controls so you will always be uncomfortable playing this.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake I made and jump the gun on this one.

We get what they say is increased resolution... but honestly doesn't look much better.\u00a0 And they slapped us square in the face (square...pun intended)\u00a0 with the fact that it's STILL 4:3 aspect ratio. A friend said \"that's really difficult to convert to HD 16:9\".\u00a0 Okay... for you and me.. sure... but this is Nintendo.... the often-proven kings of that game... and for sixty bucks.... do SOMETHING with it.... please?\u00a0 Add to that the fact that it's a straight port.... the camera controls are (still) garbage.... and the controls themselves are (still)\u00a0 in the can with the camera.... and what you've got is a slightly improved resolution on a nearly 25 year old game.\u00a0 My advice? If you're playing 64 on this platform,\u00a0 set your TV to \"stretch\".\u00a0 With the upped resolution...its \"almost\" bearable.\u00a0<br /><br /> Mario Galaxy was the one title of the three of never played.\u00a0 It looks pretty decent,\u00a0 graphics wise,\u00a0 but be forewarned...if you're a pro controller die-hard like me... you're in for a rude awakening.\u00a0 Multiple news sources stated that WOULD be an option to play without motion controls..And it ALMOST is true. Motion controls are not required...in handheld mode.\u00a0\u00a0 In TV mode... no option.... even with a pro controller you have to use motion controls... and that's just clunky as hell... The better option is to play with joy-cons.... but i absolutely, morbidly despise Joy Cons. They are the bane of my existence.\u00a0\u00a0 And I don't play in handheld mode.\u00a0 So, if you're like me... docked and a pro- controller user...There's no way to play without motion controls.\u00a0 Not acceptable to me... especially given the horribly misleading news prior to release stating the contrary.\u00a0 If someone figures out that I'm wrong... and can tell me how to do that... I'll listen.

Little focus on skill.", "text": "So many flaws. You could do literally everything perfect sometimes and still lose because of getting hit with a blue shell at the last second. It's especially annoying when you should have had a much larger lead. If you watch the A.I you can see they're not very skilled but somehow they're always right behind you. When they're in front of you it's impossible to predict what box they're gonna get because they move side to side in random directions. In 200cc it you need to press the brake but the A.I doesnt need to. I read that in the first mario kart it was extra hard because instead of making intelligent A.I racers they just gave them unfair advantages. They are still just as lazy well over 20 years later. I don't mind losing if it's fair but its extremely frustrating when you did nothing wrong. Also the vehicle strengths and weaknesses are inaccurate. I choose a vehicle that was better than the one I use and it had less control even though it said it has better traction and control. Another bs addition is making you pay to play online. This was free on wii. All the unlockable stuff is worthless. You would think everytime you unlock a vehicle it would be better than the last one but it's not. If you beat every level you get gold mario but he's not better than the other characters. I would say the worst thing about the game is getting hit with 4 things in a row and going from first place to last place. This goes back to a point I made earlier. Not only should u not be able to get hit that many times in a row but most times it makes no sense that everybody is right behind you even though u've driven perfect. As I said earlier losing isn't that frustrating but losing when it makes no sense is extremely frustrating. Especially when to get 3 gold stars u have to finish 1st in 4 races in a row. Out of these 4 races some bs is bound to happen on one of the tracks which ruins your 3 gold stars. And yet another flaw, after that bs happens, you can't just retry the race. You have to start all 4 races from the beginning. And with 200cc it's not fun. You have to constantly press the brake(some tracks are more annoying than others) and ot doesn't make sense in terms of physics. Whether you're going super fast or just starting off you have the same crappy control. Sometimes you get stuck against the wall even when pressing the brake. Another thing that is absurd is the boost you get when driving behind people. If everybody is driving close together you'll get a boost you dont want that sometimes sends you flying off the edge in levels like rainbow road. Again this is especially frustrating because it's sometimes unavoidable and not your fault. Also on levels like rainbow road I end up in first place only getting mushroom boosts that you cant even use because of the lack of straight track. I'm sure there's more flaws I haven't thought of but I'll leave it at that for now.<br /><br />Since I included so many flaws ill also list some positives....<br />-solid graphics for a mario kart game<br />-i like that there's  2 ways to stop the blue shell<br />-until you reach 200cc, drifting is pretty fun when you master it<br />-decent amount of levels, even though they use old levels to make it seem like there's more levels than there really is(this goes back to them being lazy like with cheating A.I drivers). I like playing older levels but there should be more new ones.<br />-good amount of characters to choose from<br />-rain looks pretty cool<br />Just like the flaws there is probably some positives I'm forgetting", "images": [], "asin": "B01N1081RO", "parent_asin": "B06XXLZFWX", "user_id": "AGKGNGOXWI7Q4IVTG4STZA67VAZA", "timestamp": 1632394730474, "helpful_vote": 34, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fun", "text": "I think this game is really fun.

(27 after two days I posted this review) Most of you who have this game understand completely why these three Mario games were some of best during your childhood. I'm one of those people. Now I understand people can play these already from some emulated port for PC, but it feels wonderful to finally see more throwback 3d games from previous Nintendo consoles on to the Switch.<br /><br />I was screaming when Sunshine showed up in the collection. As a kid in the early 2000s, It was actually my 2rd most frequently played video game during the GameCube Era. Mario64 was okay, I haven't really played that much on the 64 due to the cartridge kept getting dirty and causing it to freeze too often. Of course I had no idea how to properly clean it back then. As for the Mario Galaxy, I never owned the Wii but my niece sure did. When she first got it on Christmas and showed me the game-play, I was completely invested. I even took over her Wii just for that purpose. What a horrible Uncle I am, but she didn't mind.<br /><br />Real talk about the three games. All of them resembles as an album of respected Mario titles that were well praised in their respective console eras. It also tells the next generation of gamers how our gen feels about these 3 particular titles. Now would love to give an all out 5 Star review to this but I wish they added a little more features in the main collection menu. The complete soundtrack is nice and all, but I was hoping they would add some rough/finished concept artwork, sketches and maybe even some fan-art back in those eras. I would like to see some personal interviews with the Lead Developers and Designers of the 3 games. Koji Kondo would really surprise me.<br /><br />Overall, I love it and there's no way I'm ever going give or sell this game to anyone for as long as I live.<br /><br />Thank You Nintendo! :)", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AHTRDNJKG2VPXCJMHKMSQY445QHA", "timestamp": 1601173120038, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Thank you", "text": "Awesome", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AHH2GJZFL6ZFADSA3X3JHUTJMIMQ", "timestamp": 1575900963932, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "\ud83d\ude10", "text": "\ud83d\ude10", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AEAXAFV56JUFMTOUVXMNI6YNV3SQ", "timestamp": 1572795318244, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love the game!!!", "text": "My wife and I can't stop playing the game.

(Docked)<br /><br />- Super Mario Galaxy runs at 1080p 60 FPS, up from 720p 30 FPS. (Docked)<br /><br />- This is the updated version of Super Mario 64, that fixes the backwards long jump glitch and removes some voice lines from Mario I.E. \"So long, King Bowser!\"<br /><br />- You are not able to change the camera options in Super Mario Sunshine, you can however change the controller settings outside of the game if this is a big enough issue for you. However there is nothing you can do for the lack of analog triggers. I didn't see this as much of an issue personally.<br /><br />- These are NOT remakes. A few textures are updated here and there, and the UI is updated where is needed, but overall this will be the exact same experience you played through the first time, at upgraded resolutions.<br /><br />- You can turn your screen off while listening to the soundtrack, which is a great feature for listening in bed or on the go.<br /><br />Overall this is a great package, so long as you know what you are getting.

I was excited to see that Nintendo was giving fans a chance to relive the glory days of 3D Mario on their newest and dare I say most popular console, the Nintendo Switch ( not to say the new games are bad, the old ones just have a certain magic to them ). I honestly don't know what I expected. The controls are a bit weird to get used to, ( especially in Mario 64 and Sunshine ) but to me that's excusable considering 64 and Sunshine are quite \"ancient\", if you want to describe it that way. One gripe I do have is the camera, something just feels wrong about it even though these are supposed to be direct ports, maybe I'm not used to the actual camera since emulators can slightly change things, so I'll leave that to your own discernment if you buy this game. Now, I do have two issues with this game. One major issue I personally have is that Nintendo went out of their way to remove some of the most iconic glitches in these games, most notably the back wards long jump, which allows for some fun glitches and antics inside of the game. As someone who enjoys speed runs, I can't exactly see why Nintendo did this, as a casual player would probably be too lazy/too ignorant to abuse these glitches, while the old fans and speedrunners would appreciate Nintendo not patching these glitches out. Heck, it might have even reignited a passion and popularity for speed running these games as old speedrunners could move to upgraded hardware and new speedrunners could simply buy this game and start their career of speedrunning 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy, boosting sales of not only Nintendo switches and this game, and possibly eliminate the need to support Nintendo's greatest enemy, emulation. For me it was a missed opportunity to kind of redeem Nintendo's social status and have them reconnect with their player base since they haven't been the exactly been greatest and consumer friendly company the last 2 years. The second gripe I have is a minor one, and that is Nintendo's motion support for the pro controller in galaxy. Thankfully, Nintendo was smart enough to keep the cursor reset button but still it's a pain to use the pro controller, and I don't think anybody wants to use the barely functional joy-cons. Regardless of my complaints, I still think this is a great title worthy of buying to gift for somebody who has recently become a fan of the Mario series/long time fan/new switch owner.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AF5GQS2735GFILP3HZHHS7RFGPEQ", "timestamp": 1640836767961, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "If you're here for a review, just buy it.", "text": "If you've come to look at the reviews to see if it's a good game for a kid.. ages 3-15, just buy it.

Barebones? Yes, it is at times.  It would have been great to see the games rebuilt from the ground up, or remastered in their original format with additional flourishes regarding graphics and imagery.  At times, it seems like Nintendo just hit a button labeled UPSCALE GRAPHICS and poof!  This game popped out.  I am disappointed?  Absolutely NOT!  I'd rather have this than nothing.<br /><br />Mario 64 is probably the one that really needs to be built from the ground up again, but it is fine the way it is because this is how it originally was.  Gamers that never experienced this game back in the 90s because they weren't born yet shouldn't immediately dismiss it.  This is a true masterpiece and it was amazing to see such a huge leap from 2D to 3D done right.  The camera can be a bit janky at time, but still a great game regardless.<br /><br />Sunshine and Galaxy look amazing.  It is probably the best they will ever look unless Nintendo decides to do a hardcore 4K HD remaster.  Everything is upscaled and the visuals looks crisp, sharp, and clear.  Great to have these games is HD and happy to have them play on a modern day flat screen TV without red, white, and yellow cords.  Yes, you can use the pro controller (thank goodness) for Galaxy, but when certain touchscreen options come on screen, there is no other option but to remove it from dock mode.<br /><br />I do wish the DS and Wii New Super Mario Bros 2D games were on here along with Mario Galaxy 2, and New Super Mario Land 3D from the 3DS.  I hope these games will be considered for a future collection release.  Pick this and support them  You won't be disappointed.  These are all masterpieces and true treasures.  A mascot that has been in the game for 3 plus decades, and the best he'll ever look for a modern day console.

This might be a me thing as I didn't play much sunshine in the past but it's definitely a much better version of the game than the original as far as visuals and gameplay.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy has to be the best it's ever been here, once again 60FPS and 1080 the controls work great whether you are using the joy cons, the pro controller, or handheld. I will admit, handheld might be the least intuitive out of the three as you need to touch the screen to collect starbits.

I've also never owned the original consoles for which these games initially debuted.  While many in the comments will give their opinions based on specifications and nostalgia, I basically am giving this review as someone looking at this with fresh eyes/hands.<br /><br />Super Mario 64: it looks fine but the 3rd person camera placement is difficult to work with.  The graphics are solidly outdated, but if you've never played before, the mechanics aren't terrible.  It's \"good for what it is\", which is basically my way of saying that I might come back to it later.  I had similar camera troubles with Ocarina of Time for the 3DS.  I think I may just be too old to go back to this one.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine: the idea of having Mario/Princes/Character dialogue is interesting, but a little off-putting. The game itself is pretty fun. Unlike Mario U or 3DLand (mostly side scrolling), the worlds/levels feels far more open.  The mechanics took some time to get used to both docked and undocked, but I can say that I enjoyed playing this game. It feels like a not-mario Mario game.  In some ways I can see Breath of the Wild having been influenced by some design aspects of this game in particular.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy: I'm still getting used to this one, but it's a very fun game and graphically and gameplay wise a bit more interesting as well as advanced.  This one I haven't beaten, but I think I would already like to play the follow-up game as well (I hear it's quite good). This is probably the best of the 3, though I do enjoy Sunshine.<br /><br />Both of the latter play in full screen docked which is nice. Mario 64 seems to clip on the screen. This might be another reason why I'm irked by it (besides the camera work).<br /><br />In all I think $60 is good for both Sunshine and Galaxy combined as I had never played them before.  But if you have played them previously, as well as 64, $60 is a probably bit steep.  I feel like for this price, Nintendo could have leveled-up/refined the graphics somewhat.  But it is what it is and I can at least play this on the go.<br /><br />5 stars for trying to put 3 games in one cart.<br />2 stars for not bothering to update graphics.<br />5 stars for the fun of Galaxy and Sunshine.<br />1 star for Mario 64. It really feels half hearted.<br />3 stars for controls being a little strange.<br /><br />I would give it 3.5 stars, but I guess rounding up to the whole star is what I'll do, so 4 stars.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AEVR3HKOB7BE5T75SCGQWVVIOBMA", "timestamp": 1600817852563, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Gift", "text": "My daughter loves this game.

Love old games and platinum'd Meat Boy, Sekiro, and nearly Death Stranding so I'm used to hard and frustrating, but holy cow 64 and Sunshine need quality of life updates BAD.<br />Played a bit of Mario 64 and had to stop because the camera is just awful and it has not aged well. Unless you're already really familiar I just don't see anyone enjoying it unless you REALLY like kinda clunky 3d platformers<br />I'm 33 stars into Sunshine and it's just such a slog getting kicked to the main area every single time you die that I'm already getting tired of it.<br />L1 brings up a map which has a 3 second animation to open and close every time you accidentally press it trying to long jump or whatever.<br />long unskippable cutscenes, slow text boxes<br />Your fludd nozzle gets changed anytime you go anywhere so i tend to fall to my death expecting to have the hover jets equipped constantly but nope.<br />It's by far the most charming 3d Mario I've played but it's rough.<br />Just started Galaxy and it still has the Wii UI and you have to use motion controls just to select a save spot and start the game. changing my rating to 1 star, i hate this and am going to sell it as soon as i get tired of Sunshine<br />Edit*<br />64 doesn't get better than just jumping around the castle for me, the levels are just not very fun.<br />Got 83 stars in Sunshine and im not bothering with the last 2 red coin missions. It's a buggy, untested game with lots of charm but it generally kinda sucks outside of aesthetics. Every problem I listed annoyed me the entire playthrough. Also every single thing involving yoshi is bad. Feeding him, the unmovable egg, spawn location, dying in water, and i think he just explodes when his fruit meter runs out? i honestly dont get why they even put him in this game. its just redundant with fludd, he jumps slightly higher and sprays water... cool.<br />Galaxy is weird. collecting sparkles sucks and it has the worst camera of the bunch, touchscreen is bad, button prompts are big shaking joycons, and the beginning is kinda awful. but once i started crawling around on the giant bee it got a lot better.

Concept art, game commercials, trivia, in-game saving, cut scene skipping, new levels, and other additional content. None of which is here.

This is considering the age of the games. You could do better by emulating this yourself on Dolphin and injecting your own textures. It's truly a cheap port and barely an improvement.<br /><br />The games as a whole are great. SM64 is as about as perfect as could be for a N64 Mario. Sunshine is actually the best, because it improved on 64 without straying too far from the linear fun of the Mario franchise. Galaxy would be more fun and better, if not for the gimmicky controls, and the repetitiveness of running around on tiny planets inappropriately called \"galaxies\".  They are all worth the roughly $20, if you didn't get to play one or all of these, and don't want the trouble of emulating it yourself.<br /><br />More on the physical aspect and Nintendo, the cartridge was actually ruined by the ESRB. Nintendo can't really control that, but you should know that the main logo is offset, and that will bother many people who overpay for this $60 piece of plastic. This game is supposed to be a \"limited print\", to celebrate Mario's 35 years, yet it is the sloppiest anniversary I've ever seen. It doesn't come with an actual sound track, no art, no steel book, cards, golden tickets, condoms, or even a simple thank you note. It's genuinely cheap through and through, and it's even more disappointing that the fact that there's still no new F-Zero, because at least they know not to do that if they can't do it right.<br /><br />Overall, it's only worth it if it's $60 or less, and if you're a normie who isn't picky with the quality of the physical game.

If you\u2019re a fan of Mario, this is a MUST-HAVE.<br /><br />With that said, the price for this collection feels a bit steep. Super Mario 3D All Stars includes the three games mentioned above, as well as the official soundtracks to each game inside the software.<br /><br />One of my biggest disappointments with this is the seemingly lack of effort put into this collection for several reasons, including quality of life improvements and lack of extra content related to Mario\u2019s 35th anniversary. At launch, the software felt rushed because of random glitches and slowdowns that weren\u2019t even present in the original versions. These games are obviously running at a higher resolution than their original counterparts, so this should probably be expected- but these games are decades old now. Aside from emulation quirks that arise, you\u2019d think that Nintendo would have put extra care and time into the development for this. I also think Nintendo could have done more things to improve upon the games, namely Mario Sunshine\u2019s gameplay quirks- but I suppose that\u2019s more forgiving if it involves changing source code.<br />There\u2019s also not much content in terms of celebration. The soundtrack is all that is included, and it\u2019s hard not to complain when past special editions included art books and physical soundtracks, or some kind of token- the last Mario anniversary release included these, albeit with a Super Nintendo game from the early \u201890s on a Wii disc, but it was priced ten dollars less.<br />It\u2019s also inevitable to compare this collection to other similar software: Crash Bandicoot N. Same Trilogy and Spyro Remastered are two collections that completely REMAKE the original trilogies with new graphics, include extra content like development archives, and are priced at twenty dollars LESS than Super Mario 3D All-Stars. By no means should Nintendo have remade all three games, but the pricing of $59.99 left me confused and even felt cheated.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this if you really want to play these games on your Switch.

I should note every game here controls EFFORTLESSLY on Nintendo Switch. The controls for Super Mario 64 are especially impressive, considering how poorly the game ran on Wii and Wii U. Super Mario Sunshine gets a much needed widescreen addition, which really helps the game. And for those of you concerned with how Galaxy has been adapted, rest assured the game works great (if not even better) with the option to use traditional controls instead of motion controls. My only gripe with this collection is the lack of Super Mario Galaxy 2, which I  desperately hoping is added down the line as paid DLC. The collection lacks a lot of features used to flesh out other collections (such as a museum or a promotional material showcase), but I personally believe this collection is perfectly fine without it.

Most, if not all the controls do not feel optimized for the Switch at all, especially Mario 64. I haven't played Sunshine yet, but Mario Galaxy has to be my favorite of the three. God, what a beautiful game that's slightly ruined by the fact that, yet again, the controls could use some work being adapted to the Switch. Motion is very bad, and collecting the stars still feels like it should be with the Wiimote.<br /><br />Overall, I get what Nintendo was trying to do with this collection.

If you were to buy Mario 64 physical for the n64 it could cost you $30-$35 , Mario Sunshine could cost you an easy $50 & Mario Galaxy can easily cost you $30 so in total if you bought them individually it would cost you over $100. For just $60 you get all 3 games with full HD 800p to 1080p in dock mode & 720p mobile. You can tell the difference especially when you play mario galaxy which originally on the wii you were getting 420i & now to get 1080p is amazing. If you lied to me & said that it's a next gen mario game , I'd be fooled.<br />They throw in digital soundtracks for all 3 games & then you have the fact it can be played on the go.<br /><br />Cons.<br />The bare bones job Nintendo did is shameful. This is supposed to be a 35th anniversary so where's the manual ? An art book ? A physical soundtrack ? Perhaps a mini figure ? Where's Mario Galaxy 2 ?<br /><br />Final thoughts.<br />If you looking for a decent platformer compilation, you can always count on mario & super mario 3d all-stars is good enough to satisfy that itch.

I would rate it higher, but the online capability on the Switch is abysmal. Years ago, we tried networking a few devices to play over local connection (two iOS devices and a Switch). Even with that simple setup, we suffered frequent connection disruptions. By now, you would think that Microsoft would have improved things. The game now claims to offer online multiplayer on the Switch. But I found it to be utterly broken and non-functional. I have a solid internet setup at my house. But the game always fails to connect me with my Switch friends online. Signing in with a Microsoft account seemed to work better at first. But then it inexplicably started causing the game to lock up whenever I logged on with the Microsoft account.<br /><br />It's a completely broken and frustrating experience trying to use the online features. If you stick to the single-player game, it's enjoyable as a simple little sandbox game. If Microsoft can't get the online experience right, they shouldn't claim that the game is playable online.

I was stoked by the rumors that there'd be a 3D Mario Collection, imagining everything it could have been. Instead, what we got was a lazy port of 3 games with only the bare minimum level of enhancement. I get that Nintendo was trying to go all preservationist as they do with their classic NES and SNES games, but the fact is, 3D games, especially early 3D games, just don't age as gracefully as the previous generations did. Take Super Mario 64, for instance. Much like Super Mario Bros., this was a genre-defining game and was mind-blowing at the time. The original Super Mario Bros. remains a near-perfect platformer to this day. But when Super Mario 64 came out, 3D platformers still had a lot to work out, and they have grown and evolved since then in almost every way, leaving this game in the dust. And as a result, it's almost unplayable today. No, I'm not going to repeat the classic complaints about it not being in widescreen or the graphics being blocky. I can see past those things, and to be honest I forget that it's even in 4:3 almost as soon as I start playing. I'm talking about things like having modern camera controls. This would have been one of the easiest things to implement, and it would have made the game SO much more enjoyable. Instead, I have to deal with endless frustration of missed jumps due to not being able to see Mario or his surroundings properly. As I said, in 1996 this game was amazing, but this isn't 1996, and I'm not playing it on an N64 with an N64 controller. In 2020 it comes off feeling broken and borderline unplayable. These three games, and Super Mario 64 in particular deserved better. The Mario franchise deserved better. And most of all, Nintendo fans deserved better. I'm just sad that so many people buy this game up and continue to rave about it. Just face the facts- Nintendo dropped the ball on this one, and unless people start to admit it, this won't be the last time.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AFUW7LXUQYDF2ASTLQQKQ5GR2XBQ", "timestamp": 1604853155298, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nintendo can get away with any price they want", "text": "Honestly very overpriced for what you are getting.

It is what it is.<br /><br />When it comes to other things, for example the offhand slot in game, it is EXTREMELY limited in comparison to the PC version where you can offhand virtually any item in the game. With this version, you can only effectively use in the offhand maps, and shields. Shields in particular you use by \"sneaking\"/crouching.<br /><br />Besides those things, it is by all means Minecraft, and relatively up to date to boot as this is the \"Bedrock Edition\".<br /><br />One of the more impressive features is the ability to play fully locally with up to four players simultaneously EVEN IN TABLETOP mode!<br />There is a local wireless play as well. So if your friends have their Switch's with them, you can play with them even without the Nintendo online service. So if possible, to play effectively with others, try playing locally on one Switch, or attempt to play via local wireless with multiple Switch systems.<br /><br />Yes Command Blocks are in this. So you can make those \"in game mods\" that are implemented solely by Command Blocks. That alone is a very powerful feature to be present.<br /><br />As for any additional tips for this particular version I can give is, try going into the settings, go to the control rebind section(s), and bind \"Jump\" to \"clicking\" the Left stick. Then bind \"Sneak\" to the Right stick click. Those two bindings in combination helps a lot I've found.<br />Do note that as of 1/29/2020, there doesn't seem to be any way to disable \"double tap forward to dash\". So if you want to sprint, tap forward twice and you'll sprint. It would've been nice if it had a checkbox to disable that in case you wanted to bind sprinting to something else and not accidentally sprint from double tapping forward.<br /><br />All in all, if you goal isn't the online multiplayer, or you used the offhand feature and love it to death on PC, you're better off staying on PC/Windows-10-Version. If you can live with those compromises, or your party of friends like to play locally to begin with, its a great time! Its definitely a lot more manageable to make those large buildings by chipping away at your tasks a little bit at a time. Which is really easy to do due to the nature of the Switch.<br /><br />Do note that in order to play with others locally on one Switch system, you'll need to give your friends some sort of controller that has two joy sticks. You could hypothetically use a gamecube adapter in docked mode, and let your friends play with you via Gamecube controller. So no, you cannot play with one Joy Con per player in this game.

The game was absolutely stunning at that time, no other 3d platformer was nearly as good.<br />25 years later... I'm glad to re-play this but certain aspects of the game really didn't age well.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is the camera. Wow, does the camera stink in this game!  It was really innovating to be able to control the camera back in the days that you'd look past it's flaws, but by today's standards it's just very messy and not ok. It just sometimes refuse to move or stay where you want to stay in areas where precision is required. Not a deal breaker but it's certainly frustrating.<br /><br />Overall Mario 64 still has magical moments, it's certainly a classic and I mostly enjoyed playing through it, some parts of the game and certain textures are actually surprisingly pretty, like inside the pyramid (and has very little to do with the resolution increase in the port). And the music is still awesome.<br />But Nintendo really should have at least fixed the camera and some of the uglier textures if they didn't want to do bother with a (well deserved) remake to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Coming up with a follow up to Mario 64 that wouldn't disappoint fans was a very hard endeavor even if Nintendo tried hard, and I don't think they really did it with Mario Sunshine. Wasn't a favorite when it was originally released on the Gamecube and I still dont care much for it. Unlike 64, the game's graphics aged surprisingly well though.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy is the best of the bunch, the spiritual successor to Super Mario 64. I played this so much on the Wii that I still don't feel ready to fully replay this game, but if you didnt play any of those games before it's for sure the best. The formula was improved even more on Mario Galaxy II - why the heck isn't it included here??<br /><br />Overall it's hard to review this. It's a collection of very lazy ports of fantastic games. No interesting extras just the soundtrack.<br />Super Mario 64 especially should really have been cleaned up (poor camera, some ugly textures)<br />I recommend this if you are really  craving some nostalgia time with any of the games in the collection. Otherwise,  Nindendo did little to make them appealing to today's standards.<br />Try harder, Nintendo.<br /><br />I added an extra star from my original review as two stars was a bit harsh considering the high quality source material.

Could they have done better.... maybe but its still an amazing game. Slow down present in the Wii-U version is none existent so this make the best version you can buy.<br />Mario Sunshine - Never looked better. Upgraded to full HD widescreen it looks great and probably the most straight forward to play. While some didn't like the original I still think its a gem and well worth the time.<br />Mario Galaxy - The most recent also the best looking. Controls are a bit wonky but the mind bending puzzles are unlike anything you see in other Mario games.<br /><br />In summery.... if your a collector or plan to play it mobile buy the cartridge.

Mario Sunshine looks nice but suffers from some strange mechanics and I frankly didn't play it much and would even argue M64 is a better experience.  Galaxy is probably my favorite as it appears this is when Nintendo finally polished up the 3D experience and will probably be the only one I'll finish.<br /><br />In hindsight, I somewhat regret spending $60 on this, but fans of the originals should enjoy this.  5/5 for classic reasons, but 2/5 for modern enjoyment.  Maybe I just don't have patience for fussy platformers anymore and I kept thinking I'd rather be playing something else more refined.

I was excited about the ability to play it on the Switch.<br /><br />PROS<br />For the first time in history, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy are available on-the-go. The graphics of Super Mario Galaxy look fantastic in HD. The motion controls of Super Mario Galaxy worked well in both tabletop mode and docked mode, despite the Switch not having a sensor bar like the Wii. Some people have stated that the lack of a sensor bar ruins the motion controls in Super Mario Galaxy, but I had no problems with them.<br /><br />CONS<br />I was expecting Nintendo to provide some enhancements to each game in this collection, much like how the original Super Mario All-Stars consisted of enhanced remakes of the original NES games. I knew that Nintendo was probably not going to completely remake these games from scratch, but I was hoping that Nintendo would at least improve the controls and the user interface.<br /><br />Instead, this collection consists of glorified emulation. I found myself constantly fighting the camera controls in both Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario 64 is not even rendered with a 16:9 aspect ratio, so it looks even more dated.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />If I wanted to play Super Mario 64 just as it appeared in 1996, I would have simply powered-up my Wii U and played the Virtual Console version of it. If I wanted to play Super Mario Galaxy just as it appeared in 2007, I would have simply powered-up my Wii U, booted into Wii mode, and then inserted my Super Mario Galaxy disc. I expected this release to offer something new, and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have waited until watching gameplay footage before dropping $60 on this game. However, I pre-ordered this game because I feared that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited release window, this title would be difficult to buy later-on.

I had previously played all three of these titles on their original consoles, so I was curious to see how they upgraded the camera and controls. I soon discovered the answer: they didn't. All three games are straight ports of the originals with a resolution upgrade and little else. They did add a music player so you can listen to the music from all three games, and while that's kind of cool, in practice who actually uses this feature?<br /><br />The resolution on Super Mario 64 is sharper but the textures are still from 1996 which results in some sharp UGLY textures. And man is the camera ever horrible. I can understand that this was Mario's first 3D adventure, so I forgave the original for having a camera that's difficult to control and at times unresponsive. But in a collection such as this, I think it's pure laziness on Nintendo's part that the camera controls were not at least modernized to eliminate some of the original's issues. It is mapped to the R stick but the responsiveness is the same as when it was mapped to the N64's \"C\" buttons. It will swing wildly behind Mario at inopportune times and obscure what's in front of you. It's hard to position to see far enough out during the platform sections, so you often will miss a jump. And when you do try to reign it in, it will often get stuck on the landscape and not move at all. Mario himself still controls like his clunky '96 self, so he tends to slide quite a bit when trying to stop and making precise movements with him over a narrow platform is often a lesson in patience.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine benefits more from the resolution bump and looks beautiful in the new expanded aspect ratio. It appears they did not upgrade the in game movie parts however and it's pretty obvious from their blurry appearance. This is a bit of nit picking however. Unfortunately, the game again suffers from lazy control ports. While the F.L.U.D.D. was easy to control with the original Gamecube controller, the button mapping is now awkward and has a steep learning curve before you truly feel even a little bit comfortable with it. One button lets you fire in place and control the up and down with the L controller. Another button lets you fire and strafe, and yet another lets you fire straight ahead while running. I often times was completely frustrated by the lack of control I had over the stream in boss fights and during platforming sections (Hotel Lobby...!!) and can't help to think there could have a been a better option for the controls. It's hard to remember what button does what and often results in moving Mario when I meant to leave him in place or vice versa in the heat of the moment. The camera is the same as the original, and while it's a marked improvement over Mario 64's, it still is a product of it's time and is often difficult to line it up precisely in the platforming sections or while using the hover attachment. So be prepared to fall often.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy suffers the least in this collection and what is already one of Mario's most gorgeous looking adventures is even better looking with the resolution upgrade. There are motion controls in the game, which I'm not sure could be changed given the original Wii's remote, but they are implemented about as well as you can expect. The camera in this one won't give you many issues, because it's excellent compared to the previous two games. It moves with the action and is always about where you need it to be. Corrections that are needed are usually only small adjustments one way or the other. And while all three games have a great soundtrack, this one really shines and is one of my favorites of all Mario games.<br /><br />There is a certain nostalgia factor that is included with these games for people such as myself, so regardless of the lazy collection, I will still play it. And that's what Nintendo seems to bank on. While the original Super Mario All Stars featured upgraded graphics and small control tweaks, Nintendo seems to think this is no longer necessary even though one only needs to look to the internet to know how good Mario 64 could look given a little extra TLC. Also, the absence of Galaxy 2 is puzzling and a little disappointing. If these Mario collections are supposed to truly be \"a collection\", then why leave parts out? I fully suspect they are planning a re-release like they are doing with Super Mario 3D World in order to milk a little more money out of diehards like myself.<br /><br />So for those that have fond memories and an affinity for all things Mario, you're probably going to buy this anyway. But for those looking to experience these games for the first time, I'm not sure this is the right experience. You would be better off playing them on their original consoles so you can use the original control scheme mapped to each consoles unique controllers. It's kind of a shame really.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AHALBRDYQMOMFLZF5U2D3OGBHLIQ", "timestamp": 1600633040042, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Brutal", "text": "Est\u00e1 bien bueno el juego tanto los ni\u00f1os como los adultos lo disfrutamos mucho", "images": [], "asin": "B01N1081RO", "parent_asin": "B06XXLZFWX", "user_id": "AGMI76PQCBRN7PNIXDLJ23H43ASQ", "timestamp": 1673621656843, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "good", "text": "good", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AGTGWF7ZUWFGK47LPZ4VBJIZDH3A", "timestamp": 1602916980694, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good game", "text": "I\u2019m definitely picking up my copy today of this game!

People are fooling themselves if they think that full remasters would have been bundled into a collection like this and for the money this is in my eyes a great deal.  the limited release is a pain for new customers and I am not a fan but if you can get this now and have missed even one of these games I highly recommend the purchase.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AHX56SJXZRWV7XEYYZF2IENQ6B5Q", "timestamp": 1614015145224, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love it", "text": "Love this game", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AHL6P7PIL4BH2YRV4SEQF5WZ25DA", "timestamp": 1669434582504, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "3D Mario the most fun in the sun you'll have in the entire galaxy!", "text": "Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario 64, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, and Super Mario Sunshine are the best Mario Games not just on switch; but in the history's entirety.

For example, if I have enough materials to make 3 axes, I can make the first 2, but the third will be impossible to make, even though it appears in the menu as craftable. I click and it just does nothing. I've had this happen 3 times.<br />4. I had the game completely freeze on me while I was sailing around picking sugarcane.

What I really had a problem with were the platform levels. The platform levels felt harder than they should and probably will be the only reason I wont collect all the stars. I played mario 64 next and I have not beaten it yet. Right now I'm at 102 stars. Keep in mind that all 3 of these games at literally ports. They're not remastered or remakes. They're the same copies as the original besides different controls. Think the only drastic thing they changed were the frame rates. So when I say the camera still sucksz it really still sucks. You can jump onto a platform above you and the camera will still be stuck underneath and it is a STRUGGLE to fix it so you can see where you are going. You also dont have much room to look around with the camera. The controls are also not that good. If you press down on the left analog stick too much while mario is looking foward, mario will still walk in that direction. I have accidently walked off cliffs because of this. In mario 64, It felt like they couldve done more with a 25 year old game and it just feels like they didnt really touch it much. With sunshine, it feels like they didnt play through the whole game to test it. The games are the same mario games you all know and love otherwise.

What's not to love?<br /><br />Well, a few things. First, the games have only been lightly touched up graphically; Nintendo could have done a lot more to make the games look better on the Switch (this is really apparent on Mario 64, that does not play in full screen). Given that Nintendo has released past games in HD, it feels like they dropped the ball on this collection. Second, the Switch controls weren't adapted too well for these games. Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine feel \"slippery\"; the controls are too sensitive for these games, and you will get frustrated when a simple action (like walking/running in a straight line) is impossible. For Mario Galaxy, the game uses the touch screen when played in hand held which is... interesting (I kinda liked it, but I can see how others will find it disappointing). When played on the TV, the Joy-Cons have use the motion control and pointing that the Wii used but with one MAJOR difference: They are not optically aiming at the screen, but rather \"mimicking\" such action, meaning that they don't point exactly where you intend them to. This is exasperated when using a Pro-Controller. The motion control parts of the game (like Ray Surfing or riding the Star Ball) also control weirdly. I honestly wish they would have re-done the control schemes for these so that you didn't have to rely on the motion controls alone.<br /><br />The last thing about this collection is Nintendo's announcement of when it will be discontinued. I can see them making a limited production run for the physical copies, but there is no reason to remove the game from E-Store other than creating artificial scarcity.<br /><br />Despite all this, I would still recommend the collection. It is probably the best way to get these games legally for the foreseeable. If you don't have the original hardware or don't want to buy expensive copies on the used market, then this is the best solution. All three games in the collection are fantastic (even with all the flaws I mentioned above).

I wasn't too bothered with the fact that they hadn't remastered anything, I figured that would ensure smooth performance...I was wrong.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when excitedly powering on Mario 64 for the first time in 20 years (aside from the incredible delta between the graphics I remember in my head vs what was pictured on my screen) was the lag.  If I'm trying to emulate a game on my Rasberry Pi, that kind of lag is frustrating, but understandable.  If I'm playing a 25 year old game I paid $60 for on a $300 console, then that is just inexcusable.  Mario Sunshine was also painfully laggy, and Galaxy was OK.<br /><br />How did Nintendo not put any money towards optimizing the performance?  How is a $300 \"modern\" console with four 1GHz CPUs outperformed by a 25 year old console a single 100MHz CPU.  I understand the emulation overhead, but with what they are charging for this, they should have ported the source code instead of emulating.<br /><br />I feel bad for rewarding Nintendo with this purchase.

And if you're younger, I'd still recommend to seriously consider picking up a copy - to better appreciate how far Mario has come in his epic 3D adventures, and simply because some of his older stuff remains a blast to play to this day.<br /><br />Three classic games in one is tough to beat.  And even years later, I think all three titles are a blast to play.<br /><br />Nintendo enhanced the look of all three titles, so the graphics look a little nicer. And I find that gameplay for all three games transitions pretty well on the Switch console.<br /><br />Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine play pretty well for me on the Switch Pro Controller. And for the most part, I find Super Mario Galaxy works well with the detached joycons. The motion controls can take a little getting used to, but I find after a little while it begins to feel natural.<br /><br />I would say Super Mario 64 hasn't aged perfectly well. The 1996-era graphics, awful camera and at times finicky controls can be frustrating. But this is still a very fun game - I'm also a sucker for nostalgia.<br /><br />I have never played Super Mario Sunshine prior to it being in released on 3D All-Stars, and I must say that it is both terrific and frustrating at the same time. The game has aged well graphically, and the environments, movements and levels are a bunch of fun. Be warned though, if you're a casual game like me, this game can immensely frustrating at times. Some levels are brutal in difficulty (IMO), but persevering through the tougher ones does feel incredibly rewarding. I'm so glad I played this game.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun on Super Mario Galaxy back in the late 2000s, and the game still looks and plays fantastic to this day. The graphics are still quite pleasing, the levels are highly intriguing, and the overall gameplay is so much fun. This is one of Mario's best adventures for sure. The difficulty is balanced well. Some levels can be pretty tricky, and a few can be considered downright difficult, but you don't have to be amazing to beat this game. This may be the best title among the the trio of games on 3D All-Stars.<br /><br />Overall, I've had a blast re-exploring two classic Mario titles, while discovering the world of Super Mario Sunshine for the very first time. Getting three awesome titles for $60 bucks is a great deal - and if you aim to beat each one 100%, the hours you can sink in will definitely give you your money's worth. Plus, each title has pretty darn good replay value.<br /><br />So please, if you're a fan of Nintendo's iconic Italian plumber - whether hard core or simply casually - do yourself a favor and buy 3D All-Stars.

That\u2019s fine with me. The camera sucks as I\u2019m used to. Again I\u2019m fine with that. That\u2019s the game I\u2019m used to. The thing I can\u2019t get past is the controls.

But the way the controls work, it makes it almost unplayable. I\u2019m pretty bummed out about the game because it had potential. But save your money or wait for them to do an update and fix it. Some of the easiest levels are unbeatable or really, really hard. I\u2019m only at 32 stars and not even past level 8. I want to keep playing because I love it, but it\u2019s hard to play when you can\u2019t even wall jump without it being non responsive. Or when you get the flying cap you can\u2019t triple jump.

The collection comes with 3 games that all are built to control on the Switch. Super Mario 64 has added rumble, patches a few bugs and has some quality of life additions. While there isn't things like widescreen for Super Mario 64; Nintendo removed the ugly blur filter that all N64 games have and as a result it looks a lot more smooth and clear for the Nintendo Switch. Something I don't hear a whole lot of people talk about is how this is a version of Super Mario 64 we NEVER got for North America. It's called the \"Shindou Version\" that like I said about adds rumble support & patches a few things which I must say the HD rumble feels nice everytime Mario performs and action. It isn't distracting and really makes you feel like you're in the game.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine is a game that not everyone is able to play, but now can thanks to this being the first time It's EVER been released on another platform by Nintendo. It now has widescreen support, which is nice but to me I don't feel it's necessary personally. The game is scaled up to 1080p and looks great for being a gamecube game! While Super Mario Sunshine is a rough & challenging game to play to this day, it certainly is a unique experience you won't find anywhere else and I'd say buying this collection alone for Sunshine is worth it due to Gamecube prices skyrocketing!<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy has been outfitted to run nearly natively on the Switch console and out of the 3 games has the most work done for it due to the Wii's complicated nature. You can now control the pointer functions using the Joycon and even the pro controller! All of it is motion based and you no longer need a sensor bar to control said pointer. If the pointer gets out of sync, you can easily reset it with a press of a button. Not to mention, motion controls are no longer required to play this game; you can now spin Mario with also just a press of a button.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this collection is worth it to relive these great classic games from my childhood. I would drop a star due to in shipping a small portion of my physical copy was damaged but, recently Amazon refunded me $10 due to having per-ordered it and they price matched. Very nice of them so I'm keeping this at 5 stars instead of dropping it by one.

You know these games, you know they\u2019re great, and since you clicked here, you want them in a nice convenient package to play all three on your Switch. If you come into it knowing and accepting this compilation is minimal in terms of extras, you are going to have a great time.<br /><br />Upon firing up the game, you get a little juxtaposition of Mario obtaining a star/shine sprite in all three games, and it plays the jingle for getting a star in Super Mario Galaxy. Simple, but I like it, and it does a good job at getting you excited to revisit these games.<br /><br /> The game select menu gives you a brief summary of each game, and plays a song picked at random from one of the three soundtracks. Neat touch! You can also access all three soundtracks and pick whichever song you would like to play while in the menu. This is basically the one \u201cextra feature\u201d of the set.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, my biggest complaint is the fact that you can\u2019t customize the controls. The controls are responsive, and are probably the best ones they could have picked as a single control scheme to please everyone, but for people used to the originals, there is just a little bit of getting used to that could have been bypassed if they had some sort of \u201coriginal controls\u201d option.<br /><br />For Super Mario 64, I like the higher sensitivity in the joy con sticks to the original N64 analog stick. This makes it easier to turn on a dime, which especially helps for doing the flip jump, which was sometimes difficult to consistently perform in the original.<br /><br />However, the one part of the game that is MORE difficult to control, as a result of the sensitivity, is aiming the cannon. Thankfully, you\u2019re not on any time limit when doing this, but I found it more difficult to make smaller adjustments to the projectile angle without having it moving way farther than intended. ALSO, most players would probably like this, but the cannon aiming is no longer done with inverted controls, which takes a bit of time for old farts like me to get used to. Again, I know I\u2019m likely in the minority, and it didn\u2019t absolutely ruin the game or anything, but I would have greatly appreciated the option to customize the controls here to my liking.<br /><br />As for Super Mario Sunshine, you again no longer have inverted controls for aiming your water stream when using F.L.U.D.D. Same point as above: doesn\u2019t ruin the game, but I would have liked the option to play it as I remembered. However, one change is that now there are two different buttons for shooting water. More specifically, to fix your position and shoot, hold R, and to shoot while moving, hold ZR. This is much more precise than the original, in which these distinct shooting options were toggled by how far down you pressed R, which led to a fair number of situations in which you unintentionally employ the wrong style of shooting. I like this change a lot, except for one strange consequence. Since playing requires using ZR, you cannot use a Gamecube controller.<br /><br />That\u2019s right, you cannot use the controller this game was originally designed for DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SWITCH SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO CONNECT ONE USING AN ADAPTER. What a lost opportunity! Again, this could have been very easily remedied by allowing you to remap this function to a different button that is available on the GameCube controller, or else by simply allowing for a \u201cclassic controls\u201d option.<br /><br />Super Mario Galaxy...well, to be honest, I\u2019m not too far yet, but I don\u2019t have any issues with the default controls! You can easily play with one joy con in each hand to replicate the original feeling of having a Wii remote in one hand, and the nunchuck in the other. In addition, for those who dislike motion controls, you can now perform the essential spin action with the y button instead of shaking the joy con, though the latter also serves this function if you prefer. Again, this shows how the other ports could have been truly excellent by simply allowing the player to choose how they would most like to control our favorite plumber.<br /><br />As for the rest of the details about how these ports are handled, I have no complaints. The graphics show some age, but have been smoothed out a bit, most noticeably in Super Mario 64, which looks much less \u201cpolygonal.\u201d The frame rate is also higher and more consistent, which again is most noticeable in Super Mario 64. I swore at first that the game speed must have been higher! Likewise, there have been fixes to slowdown issues noticeable in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. Super Mario Sunshine now has subtitles (can be turned off if you prefer), which is great because there are moments in the game where the mixing on the voice tracks are not very clear. I was NEVER able to understand what those cops told Mario after leaving the cell when I played the original! I think some of the sound effects in Super Mario 64, like Mario\u2019s \u201cwha!\u201d when jumping, have a higher pitch than the original, but I might just be crazy. Even if I\u2019m not, you\u2019d have to be a pretty picky originalist to care. Oh, and no more \u201cso long, King Bowser!\u201d when you throw him by the tail in Super Mario 64. A more noticeable change, but again, it would be a nitpick to complain about, and people who know what I\u2019m talking about know exactly why Nintendo would opt to change this. I haven\u2019t played through these games entirely, so there might be other slight changes, but I trust that they would be trivial.<br /><br />So there you have it, all three games and what you can expect from them. No save states, no display or audio customizability, no additional unlockables or challenges, no extensive galleries or fun facts (aside from the blurbs for the games on the select screen), and most importantly to me, no options for changing the controls. However, all games are very cleanly emulated, have responsive controls, and are still a blast to play. For some, this is the only realistic option to play these games, and buying this package is a no-brainer. As for those who already own some or all of the original games and consoles, you\u2019re probably the best judge of how much value you\u2019ll get from this set. Just remember not to wait too long. As you may already know, it won\u2019t be available for purchase physically or digitally after March 2021. I really, really wish that Nintendo didn\u2019t arbitrarily impose this limited availability for people who might want to wait longer or aren\u2019t Switch owners yet, but that\u2019s another story.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AGSWG3NYEQI7GN6OHG3OPHTNBCUQ", "timestamp": 1600731787977, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great being able to play these games on the switch, but some weird decisions from nintendo.", "text": "Let me start by saying I don't mind that this is just a couple emulators that Nintendo threw together under a $60 price tag. In my opinion I'm paying for the ability to play these great games on my switch wherever I take it. Yes I can get emulators for all these games on a computer, but lugging a computer or laptop around on travel is far less convenient than using a switch. That combined with the how well Mario Galaxy works with the pro controller/joycons, you can't really replicate that in emulation.<br /><br />All 3 games seem to play well. The updated sprites and resolution look nice especially when displayed on a TV. Where things start to fall apart are the control setups. I'm not sure why they did this, but they bound A and B to the same buttons in the games. This is really weird and feels unnatural. They were obviously trying to make these games utilize all the functions of the pro/joycon controllers. They utilize the thumb stick buttons to replace certain things which is also quite weird when going from playing these games on their original console, to this emulator.<br /><br />By far and away my biggest problem is with sunshine. I was a biiiig sunshine fan when I was growing up and I still have 2 copies of it for my gamecube. I guess I never really realized that the controls for sunshine were inverted, I just got used to it and now whenever I play it my mind automatically goes back into \"sunshine mode\" and I play fine with the inversion. I understand that most people are not used to this so making them default to non-inverted controls makes sense, but why not make in an option? They obviously messed with the bindings already to un-invert the controls so why not just make it toggleable? This makes sunshine pretty unplayable. I'm pretty hesitant to start playing it now cause I don't want to get super used to the non-inverted controls and then be terrible at the original version. Another huge issue is the non-existence of gamecube controller support. Nintendo already makes gamecube controllers and adapters for the switch, so why not let mario sunshine work with a gamecube controller? Again, they went through the effort to remap buttons so why not keep the mode compatible with gamecube? One more thing that is really weird is that the B button is now mapped to jump, so the muscle memory of hitting A->B to jump and dive (which is a very used movement mechanic in this game) is gone. That and the over-the-shoulder cam is now bound to right stick click which is really foreign.<br /><br />If you haven't played any of the original games, and this is the first time you are getting introduced to them, this is a great deal. However, if you have played them before, or are even huge fans, expect some disappointment and weird button mappings until you get used to them.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AGUXLNPQNYFQYDFY2ZDG4X3VYT6Q", "timestamp": 1600636965906, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Decent anniversary celebration with minor tweaks.", "text": "If you don't own these on any other platform this is a great way to revisit these beloved classics.

Super Mario Sunshine seems to have had the most attention with more vibrant colors all around as well as the higher resolution resulting in a much less blurry image. However this game also runs at 30 frames per second and the classic GameCube controls have been slightly altered due to differences when compared with the Switch's Joycons, even when using an adapter (so you can no longer change the water pressure.)

Sunshine and Galaxy both benefit immensely from the bump up to HD, and Sunshine in particular benefits especially from the addition of widescreen. Mario 64, on the other hand, has not had many improvements made. Unlike Sunshine, 64 is still in 4:3 aspect ratio, not widescreen, and its frame rate has seen no improvements. There are much better unofficial ways to play Mario 64 these days and unfortunately Nintendo's own version falls wildly short of those. All three games are great nonetheless, and as far as official releases go, there are no other options that are better than this.<br /><br />The collection itself, however, is almost comically barebones. For a collection featuring three of Nintendo's biggest games they've ever made, I truly would've expected some more love and care to be placed in its bonus features. It offers no behind the scenes information, no concept art, no looks into cut content, no additional modes or quality of life improvements for the games included, nothing like any of that.  It offers a *single* bonus feature, and that's the ability to listen to the official soundtrack releases of the three included games. It falls short of other, less expensive collections out there today, such as the Megaman Legacy collections, the Disney Afternoon Collection, or even Nintendo's *own* Kirby's Dream Collection from eight years ago, which all feature loads of interesting and valuable side content to enjoy other than just the games themselves.<br /><br />The games themselves, to me, are worth the price of admission- but for a full $60 retail game, released to celebrate the anniversary of the most famous video game character in the world, I would've expected Nintendo to put a lot more effort into making this package seem truly special.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AEXU2QU2XSZTL42TWCGXTO4XQQHA", "timestamp": 1601146404995, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "It\u2019s gud", "text": "Gud game but dumb cause it\u2019s limited", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AFNATHRNM45MYE2GSVPAPDSXGPIA", "timestamp": 1600716227048, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Good, the Better, and the Best.", "text": "This fantastic collection of 3D Mario games is one of the best video game compilations to date!

Saw another review complaining about Sunshine's convenience factor, for a game 2 decades old. I'm confused as to why someone would buy a game they didn't want to play?? You were promised Sunshine and got Sunshine. And quite to the contrary, I think Sunshine and Galaxy hold up very well. The charm is intact, the music terrific, the platforming timeless. The mechanics still fun and interesting. (Galaxy 1 and 2 are some of my favorite games of all time)<br /><br />If you ever wanted to play Sunshine or Galaxy, here's your chance.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AFCKNARIS3H4WFIIVLH5NLGMZVXQ", "timestamp": 1600557803768, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Super Mario in real life!", "text": "spaghet", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AG4FBETXZ5GGYXBHNOBG7AJCP3SQ", "timestamp": 1609604176398, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Its good", "text": "Very nice.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AEKAQC6YRCUWVHKMK43UZAY7FUYA", "timestamp": 1600432584322, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best way to replay these timeless classics", "text": "I grew up playing these games as a kid but when it comes to Sunshine I could never finish it as a kid and now after getting this collection I finally beat it.

I don't know if I'd recommend this for $60, but you will likely never have a chance to purchase it for less.<br /><br />Super Mario 64 is a landmark 3D platformer, but it shows its age. The controls and the camera do not place nice together, especially in cramped spaces. Most of my deaths have come from sudden camera shifts, or Mario walking off a ledge because he'll sometimes move in a semi-circle when he turns around.<br /><br />The level design is incredible, the sound design is some of the most satisfying of any of the Mario series, the game oozes creativity, but if you didn't grow up with early 3D platformers it's hard to recommend. I would heavily encourage anyone to give it a try, but not for $60, and not even as part of a $60 package. A Hat in Time and Spyro Reignited much easier to recommend than Mario 64.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine is really charming, but it's bland next to Mario 64. It's another game that I'd heartily recommend giving a try, but not for $60. Everyone's mileage varies with this game. The camera is pretty unruly. It has some glitchy segments that haven't been fixed in this edition.<br /><br />For my personal experience, I've done a 120 star run of Mario 64, and I'm about to finish another one on this collection. That can be tedious at points, but it's satisfying enough for me to stick with it. I will probably never get all the shine sprites. Some missions are just that frustrating to me. I like Sunshine, but I don't love it.<br /><br />Mario Galaxy is easily the best game on here, and while I know some of the other reviews complained about it still using motion controls, this version at least has the spin move - your main attack - mapped to a button.<br /><br />I liked Galaxy back on the Wii, but I was so allergic to motion controls that even though it was obviously a great game I never got very far. Playing it with a pro controller takes some getting used to because you have to shift the whole controller when you need to move the pointer on the screen, but it doesn't take long before it feels fairly natural, and being able to do the spin without the waggle has increased my enjoyment of the game immensely.<br /><br />This is, bar none, the best these games have ever looked in a retail release. These are the definitive versions of all three games on console.<br /><br />By others means... Is a different matter.<br /><br />There's ways to play Mario 64 at 60fps, 1080p widescreen, with mods that drastically improve the camera. That Nintendo gave us Mario 64 at 30fps in 720p with some improved textures is disappointing, to say the least. The source code is out in the wild. Fans have made fantastic remasters that run on Switch hardware. If you're a first-timer, I would recommend those ports in a heartbeat over this. If you already own a copy of Mario 64 on original hardware or on the Wii, I don't see any reason to pick up 3D All Stars for this.<br /><br />Super Mario Sunshine runs about as well as it does on the Dolphin emulator. On the one hand, I'm really glad they put the effort in and that we can play Sunshine on a modern platform. On the other, it feels so low-effort.<br /><br />Galaxy probably had the fewest changes, but it needed the least amount of work. It's honestly a masterpiece. If you're a newcomer, it justifies the price tag all on its own. At 1080p, it looks like it was made for current hardware and plays like a dream on the Switch.<br /><br />If you love Mario, get this. It's a collector's item. Even if you never intend to play it, it's a piece of history. If you loved the games when you were a kid and don't own them anymore, these are the versions to get. If you played them to death or own other versions, nothing here is worth rushing to the store to get it. If you're still on the fence, don't bother.<br /><br />The only extras in this are the soundtracks for each game. It's nice to have, but I'm never going to play them on my Switch. I would've rather gotten codes for Spotify or Amazon.<br /><br />The lack of an in-game art gallery, unlockable commercials, concept sketches, etc. is extremely disappointing. As far as I'm concerned, Sonic Mega Collection back on the Gamecube set the gold standard for retro game collections, and this is nowhere close to being on the same level.<br /><br />The omission of Galaxy 2 and 3D Land also bother me. If one or both of those games were included, this would be an absolute no-brainer.<br /><br />Mario is popular enough I think you already know whether this is for you.", "images": [], "asin": "B08G3MN6KP", "parent_asin": "B08JHZHWZ3", "user_id": "AGO4W67CD52DONRG4GLEZCVLIPKQ", "timestamp": 1600654921054, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good Times, Thanks Nintendo!", "text": "I am 100% happy with my purchase.

My daughter loves playing it.  Everyone and their brother knows it's a great game.<br /><br />I am writing this review to warn parents that the company that makes the game, Mojang, cannot seem to be bothered to care about the switch version.  Until they fix the Switch version all reviews should be 1 star.<br /><br />There are game-breaking problems that you would expect to only see in the worst games you can find on the market.  It is beyond me why this company can't fix these problems because they are very basic.  Do they have trained wombats doing their coding?  The problems also seem to change over time, but are equally bad.<br /><br />For a long time, the switch version had terrible scene loading and glitch problems.  These seemed to finally be repaired by some update.<br /><br />Now the switch version, for some reason, takes 5-10 minutes to load your Microsoft Account info, which you need to play online.  If you attempt to load a game before this info loads, it just doesn't place the character creation content into the game (which many refer to as \"skins\").  This is the hair, clothing, styles for your character.  More often than not the \"skin\" info never loads regardless of time waited.<br /><br />Now if I were to play Minecraft, I'd be patient and wait for the stuff to load, and whatever I don't care what my character looks like I'll just mine or build.  To my child, and many children, part of the fun is making their character look cool.  My child changes the way the character looks like once every 15 minutes.  My child is old enough to start the game themselves, but not really patient enough to wait for the \"maybe it will load eventually, maybe it won't\" character skins.  This causes massive frustration for children.  My child essentially doesn't want to play the game because they can't change their character most of the time.  So that was $$ I just threw in the trash.<br /><br />*If* you have a child, you will also understand how frustrating it is when their friend who is playing online with them can change their character and they can't.  Since the \"skin\" loading is completely random as to whether it will work, and rarely works, you are also spending time trying \"help\" and to reload the game 10 times to see if it will load this time.  Now you just wasted an hour and half.<br /><br />All of this is ridiculous.  Character creation is really basic, you just load content.  NO, and I mean NO other game I play on the Switch or anywhere else has this basic, newb, fundamental problem.  Why is this basic function not fixable by Mojang?  Trained wombats.<br /><br />Avoid all this headache and buy the game on some other platform.", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AEGKSOU3PKYYAXH6C4NAIONHVH3A", "timestamp": 1661170513523, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Most buggy game ever", "text": "Bought this to play with my 6yo, and we basically can't play because the world either doesn't load at all or freezes so often he gets mad.

After having trouble figuring out how Minecraft was going to work under the Nintendo Online system I went ahead and bought two versions and started fiddling with it. That's when I noticed how poor the system works with 2 big problems.<br /><br />1. The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.<br /><br />2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues. I found myself disconnected on a few occasions, or situations where I could no longer see my son's avatar even though he was right in front of me (I witnessed this over facetime). Other issues like landscape (FOV) not appearing seem pretty common in multiplayer.<br /><br />The singleplayer is fine and the controls once you get used to them work great, but the primary reason I got 2 copies of this was so I could play online and that feature is doesn't work. If the problem can be resolved I'll change my review.<br /><br />Update: 6+ months later and the Nintendo Online feature still does the same thing and I've had to continue paying for a microsoft realm for us to both play on.", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AG5EJLTRQRB6DM5YBH2YW3JFRS5A", "timestamp": 1541732502710, "helpful_vote": 249, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Playing all the time", "text": "She loves it", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AH2E7YVFCY34JYYENSRLE4N56PCQ", "timestamp": 1641157953022, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bonding time with my son", "text": "This item arrived on time and was as-desribed by seller.

First off, there will be times where I will leave the game and when I come back my profile won\u2019t pop up leaving me to either wait and see what happens(which usually leaves me waiting like 5 minutes) or go through Microsoft and log in again(which can be so annoying). Another issue I have is with online playing otherwise known as Realms. There are so many bugs I don\u2019t even know where to start, so I\u2019ll just give you the cliff notes. There are times where the blocks won\u2019t break or blocks that I didn\u2019t click on will disappear, times where I will randomly lose health for no reason, and when I have to log back on the game(due to a situation I will get to later) some of my items will disappear, along with many many more. My biggest issue with this game card out of everything is that I will be playing on realms and all of the sudden the game will glitch out and tell me that my server is disconnected. I have to log back out of the game and come back in(sometimes having to restart the entire console) which can be literal torture due to the previous issues I have mentioned before. I have absolutely no explanation as to why this game card has so many positive reviews other than the brand selling this paying them off because there is no way they are genuinely enjoying this glitchy mess. I write this dissertation to say that you should not let the positive reviews fool you, don\u2019t be an idiot like me who is now stuck with this mess; turn far, far away and find another seller that can give you what you have paid for because clearly Microsoft can\u2019t.", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AHXSF4VA63UD456HGZLROOMLFC4A", "timestamp": 1623727025395, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A must have for anyone who likes to be creative.", "text": "I bought this for my grand son he loves it.", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AHO4RKUE5VSAOJXNJ4Y3JSBIFIEA", "timestamp": 1579233228530, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "love it", "text": "my grandson just loves it works great", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AHBIFIDOG23UQIB7EAIEVNVC4EQQ", "timestamp": 1540905965410, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great game on a great console", "text": "Great game on a great console", "images": [], "asin": "B07D13QGXM", "parent_asin": "B07D13QGXM", "user_id": "AF2Y43JJA6EKIS2CFKHKO7EYH5DA", "timestamp": 1576916920197, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}]
