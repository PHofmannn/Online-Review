But he did reassure me I didn't need some pheromone oil to be attractive to him so that was nice.<br /><br />It does smell really good, to me it's like a pleasant floral with a hint of citrus. The scent however didn't last very long on me and I've reapplied it at least twice in one day. That being said, my skin tends to absorb oils very quickly and as a result I don't use perfume oils very often.<br /><br />It might work better for someone else though, and I've been told it's exactly the same as the MLM Pure Romance's pheromone oil and much less expensive.",

  "text": "I love the scent of this. It may smell different if you smell the rollerball before you add it on your skin or if you roll it anywhere else because it reacts to your own body. I rubbed it on my wrist, then my daughter rubbed it on hers and I had my other daughter rub it on hers and we all smelled differently.<br />They say this is used as a pheromone and may attract people. I dont know if that is true 100% but I do know the couple times I used it, I DID have some odd, more blatant flirting by men than I normally would.<br /><br />Here are just 3 examples when I wore it: (these are 1000% true and not fabricated one bit)<br /><br />When I went to a food drive thru, I handed this guy my card at the first window. While I was waiting in line to drive to the next window and I seen him walk to the other window to talk to the other guy that will give me my food.  I pull up and grab my bag of food from this guy and after that, he walked away and a moment later A DIFFERENT guy came over and gave me my drinks. After this I had to wait for a minute because they didnt put any sauces in my bag and the window was still open a bit ( idk why but that little window thing wasnt closed all the way) and I HEARD THEM TALKING ABOUT ME. I just drove off without my sauces because I didnt know what to do üòÇ<br /><br />The next time I wore this stuff, my daughter and I went to our local flea market and wanted to shop all day and just get out of the house. We like to go there once a month because its a fun thing to do in our small(ish) country town. We were there for about 2 hours and I cannot tell you how many times I got hit on, whistled at and just straight up ogled at. To the point my daughter and I even asked each other a few times what was going on here because that type of stuff never happened when we went. This guy walked up to us and asked if I was single (I had a wedding ring on), people were saying my daughter (who is 15) and I looked like sisters and at this one booth this guy gave us a discount for the \"pretty ladies\" üòÇüòÇ OK. I AM NOT GONNA LIE. THAT WAS NICE.<br /><br />Another time I was in Walmart doing some grocery shopping and I was almost done I just needed to get waters for our house because my kids drink so so much of it. So as I was walking to the water aisle, I noticed this fit looking guy in the middle next to me standing there looking at the lunchmeat. But he was kind of eyeing me. I just KNEW he was going to go to the dang water aisle too. And what does he do? He follows me to the water aisle. I am about halfway there and he LITERALLY PUTS HIS CART IN FRONT OF MINE TO STOP ME. He asks me if I work out üòè I told him no, he said he is a personal trainer and he thinks he used to train me. I was thinking really, thats the line you came up with? So I told him no I have never done that in my life. He asked if I want to I said no but why don't you just give me your email or something and I will let you know. I didn't want to be rude and I wasn't planning to email him at all. He legit told me he don't have an email address and he would have to text me. That was such a lie. My 8 year old nephew probably has an email. I told him that my husband wouldnt like that very much. Then he said WE CAN JUST MEET UP HERE INSTEAD. ü•± He was trying so hard. I told him no thanks then turned around and once again said forget the waters because he blocked my path and I wanted to just get away.<br /><br />But the oddest thing about this whole pheromone perfume is, my husband hasn't really noticed it much or should I say, hasn'tsnt RAVAGED me more because of it. I haven't used it again in a while but I do really love the smell so maybe I will when I go to the store later. Who knows, maybe I will get all my groceries put in my car for me by some random person walking or something....üòÅ",

It truly does smell differently for everyone also! I read vanilla a few times and CANNOT smell that. On my body it smells of floral and slight citrus notes. My fianc√© loves it and says it does boost my natural body odor or as this product tries to sell - pheromones. Remember, NOT everyone can smell pheromones. This lovely perfume oil DOES ALSO fade within 30 minutes to an hour. I PERSONALLY think this oil is best for date nights, nights out, or even \"sexy time\"... if applied directly before these events. IT IS all around a good product! TRY IT FOR YOURSELF! Just because it fades a bit quickly doesn't mean it's not worth it!

It lasts FOREVER and gets more pleasant as it warms up to your skin. I really enjoy wearing it. But as far as the pheromones go‚Äîwhich was whole point of purchase‚Äî it made my significant other more cuddly for SURE, he‚Äôs normally not super cuddly at all, and I do feel he was more relaxed (we don‚Äôt live together and only get to see each other once a week), he really felt easy going once we got home from our errands. He was keyed up over some stuff and I could feel that energy while we were driving around. So it had zero effect that I could tell in public aside from just me enjoying it. Then when we got home and relaxed he was much more cuddly and loving than normal, especially after having been keyed up. He calmed down easily. We went to relax together and he barely kissed me or anything. This can be normal for us which is WHY I bought this to begin with. I was hoping it would inspire more amorous actions on the spicy side. It did, I fully believe, cause him to cuddle me far far far longer than is normal for him, and to really relax and enjoy that. We had fun and watched our fav shows which is kind of unusual mid day for him before he has to leave for home. So I do think it inspired him to be more loving and cuddly and intimate in THAT way, but it didn‚Äôt inspire spiciness like I was hoping and going for. Without this, the weekend before, he was VERY spicy. So I know things are always changing and no one thing is gonna be a cure all. I am going to experiment with it some more and I will update if anything changes. Reply if you‚Äôd like an update! Thank you for reading!",

I can‚Äôt say that I have any amazing stories like those I‚Äôve red where I put it on and 5 minutes later my husband was humping me like a jack rabbit but I have started to notice since wearing it more our sex life has increased quite a bit. Not sure if it is the pheromones or the fact it‚Äôs winter and there isn‚Äôt much else to do lol. I have a friend who has also used this in the past and she swears by it. She claims she and her husband both go wild whenever they smell it.<br /><br /> I can tell you however that I enjoy the smell very much when I wear it as it has a nice floral scent without being to over powerful. It‚Äôs subtle enough to wear with my other perfume but nice enough to wear as a standalone.<br /><br />I used to have a kit I bought that had the roller, the blue bottle with the wand and a little tin pot with a solid perfume in it but I wasn‚Äôt able to find the kit or the tin anymore when I was looking to replace my roller. I like that the roller one is small so I opted for that over the blue wand bottle this time. I actually looked in quite a few places and it doesn‚Äôt appear they make the solid perfume in the tin anymore.<br /><br />Overall I recommend to anyone looking for something new to try. The price is worth it and it is quite enjoyable.",

HOWEVA!!! (rolling my eyes) the smell literally faded with 20 minutes or less, NO LIE!! I was like WTH? as any body oil wearer knows body oils usually last a relatively extended period of time NOT THIS ONE!! there wasn't even a faint lingering of a smell. I'm assuming that with all the interest and demand maybe the consistency got watered down or thinned out a bit to keep up with demand. It's not thick as the earlier reviews described when it was first recommended nor does the smell linger as stated. My recommendation to the manufacturer, JUST DO IT RIGHT, DONT SACRIFICE THE INTERGRITY OF THE PRODUCT TO MEET DEMAND.",

  "text": "It's my friend's birthday so I wanted to buy her something special and also something that makes her smell better. I thought about getting her a birthday card too but decided against it. Then I was like, why not?? so I bought her a card after all.  I'm insecure about the card choice but feeling very confident about this \"scent\" for her. I saw some people ask if this was for men AND for women... If you're a man and you want other men crawling all over you, be my guest lol!<br /><br /> When I was reading the other reviews many women mentioned that their man couldn't get enough of this \"scent\", so I knew it would be perfect for my friend who hasn't had any sexual intercourse (she's had intercourse, just not sexual), in at least three days.<br /><br />Fast forward to the \"giving\" of the \"gift\" lol.  Is that funny, or is it just me?<br />At first she was totally offended and was like, ill paraphrase \"what...the...dot...doggity dog?! are you trying to tell me something?\" I ignored her because I was nervous so I just kept eating my nachos.  When I had built up the courage, I said to her \"I got you a card. A birthday card.\" I was still nervous, obviously. I think she knew I meant birthday card when I said 'card' the first time. On second thought, she DEFINITELY knew. But she played along like a sly little minx lol. My impression was that she liked the card but some people thought otherwise (its my word vs theirs at this point). One of the better cards I've written for sure.  Reluctantly, she put on the \"scent\" because her mom taught her (through violence) to always be polite upon receiving a gift, especially if it's given to you by a man.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />It turns out she DID like my card. I have it on good authority. She didn't LOVE it but she definitely liked it. Rumor has it, she read it twice. TWICE! I should not have doubted myself.<br /><br />Anyways, turns out the \"scent\" really works. She's had sexual intercourse every single day since then and it's been like 6 weeks. Not always with the same partner. She doesn't believe in monogamy, but there's one guy I think she likes and I bet she'd be down to boo up if he asked her to. She'd probably deny it, that clever witch.<br />How do I know how often she has sexual intercourse? she tells me. Could she be lying? Of course. Don't think I haven't thought about that. But I know her, she wouldn't lie about this.  Would she lie about liking a birthday card? Sure (but also unlikely).  Her weight? Absolutely.  Being a raw vegan? I saw that sly minx clever witch at taco bell--and I don't think she was there for the scenery, if you know what I mean ;). I think she was eating there but she looks pretty generic so it could have been somebody else.  But still. Would she lie to me about how often she has sexual intercourse? No way. Full stop. Period.<br /><br />Five stars*****",

  "text": "It smells exactly like my mother (powdery, but fresh old lady smell) so it doesn‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre a gay man trying to attract men.  I tested it and I did notice more women checking me out hence I am still giving it 3 stars. However, I‚Äôve bought pheromones years ago specifically for gay men and it worked ‚ÄîI attracted both straight and gay men and so I returned this to order and looking for that product again.  So this product is good for heterosexual men if you want to attract women BUT you will smell like my mother LOL",

  "text": "Alright, so it looks like my scent glands are perfect for this product because I smell like a musky jolly rancher. It‚Äôs subtle but it smells great.<br /><br />My husband has been struggling with his body in the bedroom so I bought this to help things along. It works. Let me tell you how.<br /><br />I had this delivered maybe twenty minutes ago. He‚Äôs working from home, so he‚Äôs distracted and his head is full, you know how it is. I applied the stuff.<br /><br />When I entered the office, he was walking back to his desk, but he stopped and came over. He kissed me very tenderly and sweetly for longer than he probably should have, with all his chats. He was smiling and his eyes were all cloudy - I had to push him off to get him going. Now he‚Äôs chatting with me, keeps getting distracted and is giving me these particular smiles. So. I‚Äôd say it works, especially because his anxiety has been getting in the way of even the small things like that. He‚Äôs definitely not thinking straight. üòâ<br /><br />I should mention that he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm wearing it and doesn‚Äôt even know I bought it, so no placebo going on.<br /><br />Of course it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve had this for long, obviously. If I remember to update, I will!<br /><br />I‚Äôd like to comment on human pheromones, so this part is technically no longer review if you don‚Äôt want to read it. I do explain my reasoning for recommending the product if that interests you.<br /><br />The science of human pheromones is a funky one because not every person can detect them. It used to be, at least it‚Äôs believed, that pheromones factored in much more in ancient times. Over the years we‚Äôve evolved not to need it so much.<br /><br />Now, some people still maintain the ability to scent others. Personally, I‚Äôm one of them. My sense of smell and perception of others is pretty darn strong. My husband has it too, though his actual sense of smell is less. In fact, it could be that you yourself can‚Äôt pick up others at all. And that‚Äôs fine! You‚Äôve just evolved out of it.<br /><br />Now, some people cry snake oil on these products for that very reason and for some of them, I‚Äôd agree, because it‚Äôs best to purchase pheromones that match with your natural body chemistry. If you‚Äôre born female, use products with copulin and other intrinsically female pheromones. Vicey versy for the men out there.<br /><br />For transgender people, I‚Äôd like to assure you that it‚Äôs not going to make you seem more like your sex at birth. Pheromones don‚Äôt work that way, so if you‚Äôre nervous about it, don‚Äôt be.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a science and a dicey one, but hey, it‚Äôs worth a shot if you have a little extra cash and not enough attention. Don‚Äôt over apply. You‚Äôre enhancing your natural scent, not replacing it.<br /><br />TL;DR: Works for me, might not work for you because science. Less is more. Apply to one wrist, rub on neck and other wrist. Be gentle or you‚Äôll break up the scent. Do your homework.",

To me it was a prominently vanilla and citrus scent that reminisced of essential oils.

Actually it was quite the opposite...<br />-I received the bottle quickly and I ripped it open and dabbed it on as fast as I could. I immediately realized I only liked the smell of this stuff from a distance, and there was an odd smell hidden in between the pleasant ones. I can't describe it other than- ass?? I was like hmmm.. is that the pheromones? I didn't know what to expect I've since never worn pheromones. Luckily that scent actually fades out after a while and it smells generally good.<br /><br />-Next test: how would my partner react? He always compliments my smell and never has it went unnoticed when I wear a new scent. Gurl......  I spent almost an hour doing the absolute most to waft the scent towards him and see if he would notice without me saying anything. Nothing. When I finally did and he leaned in closer to smell it... his reaction was like \"oh cool.\" The worst response he's ever given me on any perfume.......<br /> We actually fought later that night. It was something unrelated and I can't blame that on the scent, but I do remember in the moment the fact I was wearing this did cross my mind.<br /><br />-Work: no customers complimented it or gave me more tips than usual. I started wearing my old perfume mixed with this one since it wears off quick as well and I just wanted to use this one up so I didn't waste my money. I showed my female coworker it and let her smell. She said \"hmm. Weird\" and didn't ask to use some like she has with any other perfume. She also agreed that there was a faint off putting smell if you smelled it too closely. I gave up and threw the bottle in my purse with no intention of using it again. I didn't put the lid on well so it then leaked out and dried up and i was honestly grateful it did. Yikes.",

  "text": "First off I have to say I thought I would try this after searching for a perfume. I was intrigued when I came across this pheromone while in my search. I am always on Amazon and I LOVE reading reviews on products before I buy. Hopefully this helps someone else.<br /><br />I have a high sex drive to begin with. My partner also has a healthy sex drive. We have a great relationship. This wasn't really needed but was super curious. I am all for him wanting to pounce on me 24/7 so if this little bottle can make him want me even more I'm ALL IN !<br />Yeah that didn't happen. If fact at first I was confused because I put this stuff on and he wasn't even paying attention to me at all. First couple days I started to question myself. We typically have sex no less than 3x a day and after putting this on it went to zero for a couple days. I really tested this stuff out. I'm still using it so I'll keep you posted if anything changes. We did have intercourse heavily while wearing this pheromone but drinks were involved so I don't feel that's a fair assessment.<br /><br />Overall I say this stuff doesn't work. The smell is nice. I really like it just as a fruity scent to wear. It doesn't last long at all. It's oil based so rubs off quickly on anything. I felt the first time I tried to seduce him with this pheromone I was applying it all over. I felt I nearly took a bath in it. I live in a humid place so I just kept sweating this stuff off. I was trying to get all pretty for my man while waiting for him to get home from work. Hoping he would smell me and want to pounce me like a untamed lion. Nope! Not at all. WTH! By the time he got home I had to reapply 10x since it just kept sweating off or the oils evaporated lol no idea. Needles to say I'll stick to my banana rum because that seems to work better than this stuff. I won't be ordering again but I did enjoy the little experiment. My husband still has no clue about any of this.",

  "text": "The day I got this I was super excited. I was thrilled to sneakily attract more men. I opened the bottle with excitement. My dude told me he had something important to tell me that day, I was ready to bust this perfume out and seduce him. I rolled it on my wrists and my neck. It took a bit to get the product out, but at last it came out. In the bottle it smelled like jolly ranchers, it was very sweet. That‚Äôs how it smelt on me for a bit. I enjoyed it at first. Then my dude came to get me. He insisted that he take me to sonic so I agreed. Upon arrival, he ordered me a cherry limeade. All was good. Then out of the blue I caught a whiff of my scent. It smelled like straight trees... like I had rolled around in the Forrest and had pine all over. I can‚Äôt tell if all the w**d I‚Äôd been smoking had made my natural scent turn to trees? It was disgusting. I smelt musty. Then my dude looked me dead in the eyes and told me he was actually into my roommate. I was horrified. So basically with this instinct pheromone perfume, you will smell like skunk, but at least you‚Äôll get a free sonic drink. You might lose your man, but it‚Äôs okay. The drink was worth it. (True story, wish it wasn‚Äôt though)",

  "text": "This smells divine! It‚Äôs definitely very feminine, almost smells like Juicy fruit gum when first applied. It slowly works into your skin and then smells more like a musky vanilla fruit scent. I haven‚Äôt tried this to attract men but I do know my cat loves it quite a bit. He couldn‚Äôt stop rubbing his head on my wrist. My product did come a bit damaged on the cap, but I would assume that‚Äôs from shipping as it didn‚Äôt have a lot of protection when I pulled it out of the bubble mailer. Overall, I really love this scent! I‚Äôm sad to see the price go up due to the hype it‚Äôs getting though, these used to be $7 a bottle but now they‚Äôre $14.",
