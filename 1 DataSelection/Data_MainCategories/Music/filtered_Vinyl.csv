4,A Showcase of Lessons Learned and Love Lost - A Cry of a Soul in Emotional Torment!,"Over the years I've heard many Adele songs and she always seemed to be singing about one man from a long time ago that she seemed to have a hard time getting over. In this one she is again singing about men, men who do not appreciate her for the beautiful soul she is. My one thought after listening to this CD is that Adele needs to fall in love with God, not another man! Her soul is craving the unconditional love only God can give her. A man should be second place to God.<br /><br />Many of the songs on this album are like therapy sessions where she is talking about her issues, even crying openly. I admit it is somewhat difficult to listen to unless you've been through depression and can relate. As someone who has fallen in love and been hurt in the past I know human love in a relationship falls short of most people's expectations.<br /><br />One thing I did consider is that this CD is like a warning for people who listen to it. The lyrics about just wanting to have fun even when something is not right is a huge red flag. It shows what can happen to people when they have this attitude and don't consider their spiritual health. Everyone makes mistakes!<br /><br />The battle between the heart and mind can lead a person to a state that is not pleasant to live in. Either Adele has learned this valuable lesson or she will make more albums with her pain. Yes, it is hard to try, we all can relate. But she can be free an happy again if she focuses more on God and less on men to satisfy the cry of her emotional torment.<br /><br />My copy was also cracked on the front and it was sent in a box! So not sure why all these copies are cracked! Maybe it is symbolic like something is broken. A heart!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2021-12-05 20:23:04.347,9,True

5,what's with all the hate???,"To be honest, upon my initial attempt to listen to this album, I was not in the proper space to give it my full attention and I just skipped through the tracks to see if anything immediately stood out. I usually Never do that and I will sit through most things a few times before I formulate any sort of opinion.  Having a long commute to a job, I finally had the chance to listen to it and after Several listens, I Love the album. For those of you that think it's too sad, etc., I'm sorry to say, but this is Art and sometimes what inspires the work isn't always rainbows and sunshine. It's unfortunate that there seems to be so many persons whom would so quickly dismiss the artist because it's not what they wanted to hear. That's a pretty immature thought process and y'all should check yourselves because I'm not here writing a review of your albums or critiquing any of your art. if any of you were truly artists, you would not be saying the things that you are. Everyone is entitled to have an opinion, but just because you may not enjoy something does not meant it is not good. Just some food for thought.  I'd give the album a few more spins before talking smack. I consume all types of music, mostly heavier things. Things that the common person would probably have to wear a diaper to listen to. This album has made my list of favorite releases of the year some of which are Rivers of Nihil - The Work, Whitechapel - Kin, Spiritbox - Eternal Blue, Archspire - Bleed the Future,  Brand of Sacrifice - Lifeblood, Born of Osiris - Angel or Alien, Gojira - Fortitude, Darko US - Darko,  Slaughter to Prevail - Kostolom, Vildhjarta - Masstaden Under Vatten, just to name a few.

That's not to say the rest of the song are bad but they are very personal to what she was going through and although somber at times does get hopeful.  I do like it it's just a very different album. I love 21 and 25, those albums just had a atmospheric cohesiveness that was magic.  I really thinks she's a talented singer and although this won't be a favorite album I think I'm starting to get it.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AGQHU5XGYUYTCCD475RS44Y7T5OA,2021-11-22 23:07:34.013,1,True

3,A Very Intrimate Adele Collection Focuses More on the Songwriting and Less On the Poweful Vocals,"I've been an Adele fan, I guess, since 19. Her voice soared and staked a claim right into my soul. What a powerhouse. She continued on that course, and I happily followed along - until now. I put in an advanced order for the CD on the strength of her past works. While the songwriting on 30 is superb, I am missing the inclusion of a powerhouse like Rolling in the Deep or Hello. The closest we come to having another Adele blockbuster is ""Hold On"", but if fails to achieve the same powerful vocal hold she had/has on many of her songs. I would've enjoyed the conversation she shared with us as a stand alone entry rather than inclusions as they tended to distract, rather than enhance, the songs.  No doubt this will achieve another milestone in Adele's history despite my preference for her older material.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AFQE62KSHCEHP6VVUOAEVUVTFKBQ,2021-11-21 18:21:12.359,0,False

When I first heard easy on me before the album 30 dropped I thought; I hope the rest of the album doesn‚Äôt sound like this.  Sadly I listened to this album from start to finish in one evening and found it fell flat emotionally as well as artistically.  It‚Äôs along the lines of nails on a chalkboard that so many are calling this ‚Äòher best,‚Äô and they seem to forget the power as well as the emotion of 21 for that is truly her best album.  But reviewers seem to be playing catch up to Adele and would rather kiss her feet for a subpar album than to bestow a grand title on the album 21.

5,A Much-Needed Flashback to Greatness.,"Back in 1980, when Back in Black was released, there wasn't a kid I knew in junior high school who didn't own that album. Some brought it to school with the album tucked under the arms; albums were too big for a book bag. Power-up is one of those albums you want people to know you're listening to...why? Because it kicks donkey's butt, and doesn't fall short on any of the tracks. This is the style you introduce rock and roll to the younger generation, and let them know that the old masters still do it the best and loudest.

1,"Dreary, confused & self-indulgent","Each of Adele‚Äôs albums shows a stage in her development: ‚Äò19‚Äô shows that she‚Äôs a fantastic singer with a unique voice. ‚Äò21‚Äô was focused on channeling this voice into great, memorable songs. ‚Äò25‚Äô created an entire album that felt like a cohesive effort, not just great songs but put together in a way that flows and comes off almost like a concept album.<br />‚Äò30‚Äô actually IS a concept album: it‚Äôs about divorce (specifically her own) with all the dreariness, loneliness  and regret that comes with it. Handling this concept shouldn‚Äôt be beyond Adele‚Äôs considerable range of talents. On previous albums, she expresses these feelings excellently through well-crafted, memorable songs.<br />Unfortunately, on ‚Äò30‚Äô she doesn‚Äôt.<br />The relentless grimness isn‚Äôt really the problem- it‚Äôs the songs themselves. Stylistically, it mostly goes between meandering jazzy noodling (with barely a trace of the strong melody that makes even her most subtle tunes stay with the listener) with a weird trio of bouncy, almost disco-esque tracks right in the middle that feel like they‚Äôre from a completely different album, and finishes with a few ballady songs that feel like they‚Äôre going to take off into something special but never do. Much of it feels unfinished, like these are demos instead of a finished album.  There‚Äôs also a over reliance on backing vocal tracks, some of which sound like they might be Adele‚Äôs own voice auto-tuned to different pitches and overdubbed. However it‚Äôs done, it sells her otherwise extraordinary voice short. Because of this, the lead-off single ‚ÄòGo Easy On Me‚Äô us by far the best track on the album: it‚Äôs  focused on her voice. In fact, it‚Äôs the only really memorable, single-worthy track on the whole thing.<br />The best songs from her previous efforts have a universal quality to them: you can imagine people jamming them decades from now, the way people still love the classics from the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs.  There‚Äôs nothing on ‚Äò30‚Äô that feels like it would have that kind of staying power. The pain here is specific: life-changing tragedy can make you feel confused and bleak, and this album is successful at that.  The problem is that it‚Äôs not a pleasant place to be, and it doesn‚Äôt make for a good listen. Adele is trying to make you feel what she felt, but it‚Äôs not cathartic in any way because  the lack of strong songwriting mires it down. Thus, it feels like a confused muddle with little to connect the emotion behind the song to the listener.<br />And that makes it come off as self-indulgent. The bits where she talks to her son and mumbles about being hungover make it feel even more so. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre reading Adele‚Äôs diary- it‚Äôs probably helpful to her, but there‚Äôs a reason why most people‚Äôs diaries don‚Äôt get published. They‚Äôre not for everyone; they‚Äôre for the person who wrote them and not for anyone else.<br />What also hurts the whole effort is that it took so long to come out. After 6 years, we were hoping for something better.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AELIXEW7IX6LD3MJT2DOQCEYZZDQ,2021-12-20 19:34:07.408,1,False

But it's so... to be entirely honest this CD sounds like she decided to half sing/half read her diary to a couple of notes held on the piano for measures at a time. It's sleep inducing. The ""songs"" are incredibly specific to her personally and there's nothing you can really feel, get behind, want to sing along to (I mean... how do you sing along to something so incredibly slow that you have to take a breath between basically every word in the sentence?).<br /><br />You really, really need to listen to this before paying money for it.

3,Easy on her!,"Undoubtedly one of the most anticipated music comeback releases this year (ABBA's Voyage being the other one), the UK's premium songbird after 6 years of absence returned with easily her most personal and experimental set.

After 3 listens I feel partly disappointed, partly surprised (some Amy Winehouse vibes in her delivery are so welcome to witness). I feel that Adele this time around made more of an effort to improve her looks rather than her craft. Perhaps my expectations are high due to her long absence, I just want my divas to shine to Whitney level if possible!<br /><br />I chose the white vinyl variant, a wonderful 2LP set with 2 jackets (no gatefold), and also preordered the 16-page hmv CD with slightly alternate cover artwork.

5,Power Up just might resurrect rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll.,"Just listened to it all in the car. Got floored. Got emotional. This album can put rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll back into the mainstream.

But another for your kid, one more for your nephew, one for niece, whatever. Artistry like this needs to be rewarded. ‚ÄîRazor‚Äôs Edge was a steak dinner with a bunch a mash potatoes filling the plate; Stiff Upper Lip was serious, responsible, like a very good vegetarian meal. Back In Black is a feast. Power Up is 12 tracks served like a sushi dinner, minimalist, no fluff. Songs clocking around 3:30. Or songs like haiku poems, and mini lessons in rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll as an art form.

3,HighwaytoBackinBlackHellWeSaluteYou.,"AC/DC are hell bent on repetition. Put ""Power Up"" in with their other albums and mix thoroughly. There's nothing to see here. Keep walking. Even with the loss of Malcolm Young, founding member, there still nothing new. Choose your pick from a littler of similar sounding songs.<br /><br />My picks? ""Kick You When You're Down"", ""Systems Down"", ""Shot in the Dark"", ""Money Shot"". The rest? Proficient hard rock pastiche. The one thing AC/DC has going for them is that they were once one of many, but now they are one of only a few. They still roll, but they don't rock as hard anymore. There were some tired sounding musicians on this release. It is what it is, another AC/DC album to go with the rest of my collection.<br /><br />Here's how ""Power Up"" compares to AC/DC's other works:<br /><br />1976 High Voltage (International version): Four Stars<br />1976 Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (International version): Five Stars<br />1977 Let There Be Rock (International version): Four Stars<br />1978 Powerage: Four and a Half Stars<br />1979 Highway To Hell: Five Stars<br />1980 Back In Black: Four Stars<br />1981 For Those About To Rock We Salute You: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 Flick Of The Switch: Three Stars<br />1985 Fly On The Wall: Three Stars<br />1988 Blow Up Your Video: Three Stars<br />1990 The Razor's Edge: Four Stars<br />1995 Ballbreaker: Two and a Half Stars<br />2000 Stiff Upper Lip: Four Stars<br />2008 Black Ice: Two and a Half Stars<br />2014 Rock Or Bust: Three and a Half Stars<br />2020 Power Up: Three Stars",[],B08KGT79CH,B08KGT79CH,AHL3TSH35X7273JHNHIGDTLV3VGA,2020-11-26 02:46:36.648,10,True
2,her weakest CD,"Adele  30 (Columbia)<br /><br />Celebrating her thirtieth year with her fourth album, this record shows the singer mixing elements of easy listening, lounge music, and torch songs with the occasional taste of gospel.<br /><br />The album is sparse, with the minimal instrumentation present just enough to support Adele‚Äôs wonderful voice. As such, the record is more like her debut ‚Äú19‚Äù than her most recent, ‚Äú25‚Äù.<br /><br />As much attention and praise as this CD gets, I found it to be overly spartan with most songs not being strong enough to compensate for the minimal instrumentation.<br /><br />Her voice is beautiful, but I found it to cold, emotive upon demand.<br /><br />Judging by its remarkable success, I am in a distinct minority, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />(2 stars out of 5)<br /><br />MC Mahan",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AF5IPNL5WTTROYA3TQTFTSLRVW2A,2022-03-19 19:24:16.619,0,True
4,and the band rocks on....,"AC/DC - Power Up (Columbia)<br />A new release from this popular band sneaks in under the radar with classic rock radio being the cause.<br />Why is it that current bands like AC/DC only get their old material played? Even Top 40 radio played new releases.  But new material from bands that have their older songs highlighted on classic rock radio are never inserted into the rotation. This doesn‚Äôt make sense.<br />Oh, the new record.<br />AC/DC have a patented sound. Hard rock aka metal (although one doesn‚Äôt necessarily consider all hard rock to be metal), a pounding drum and bass line moves the power chords forward with Brian doing that wonderful screech of his with Angus doing leads, this album debuts twelve new tracks that are going to please fans of the band and people who like the crunch of rock/metal to begin with.<br />One cannot help but love Brian Johnson‚Äôs vocals. Sort of a cross between a raspy scream and a crow‚Äôs caw, it works so well in the context of this approach to rock, despite the seemingly unflattering description of his voice. His voice is pure emotion without any of the trimmings. Even more than Angus, his voice defines the band‚Äôs sound.<br />And the blend of the surviving Young brothers‚Äô guitars, lead and rhythm (RIP Malcolm), also are the basis for AC/DC. Their angry loud and brash sound are the perfect accompaniment for Brian‚Äôs bird of prey coming down to snatch it‚Äôs victim vocals.<br />Not for the progressive-only minded, but definitely for the no frills rocker.<br />(4 stars out of 5)<br />MC Mahan",[],B08KGT79CH,B08KGT79CH,AF5IPNL5WTTROYA3TQTFTSLRVW2A,2021-07-22 22:47:18.844,0,True

3,It's an AC/DC Album,"The legacy: Perhaps the biggest challenge AC/DC faces is that THIS band is Legend. Two hundred MILLION albums sold. Eighteen ALbums. All of them incredibly meaningful. They have never written a bad song (or a ballad) and they responsible for some of the MOST indelible riffs in rock. Whole Lotta Rosie, Problem Child, TNT, Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Let alone Thunderstruck. A legendary band, with a reborn frontman who is arguably one of the best ever. Angus is his usual awesome self. The rhythm section is solid. It is SO good to hear Brian back in form.<br /><br />The mythology is that before he passed, Malcolm and Angus wrote HUNDREDS of songs. Sort of like how Springsteen recorded dozens of songs then skimmed the cream for the Born In The USA package.<br /><br />The best way to summarize is: Not their bast album. Only one or two songs they would play live (what's THAT in these days of Covid?). Their live show is phenomenal. But it hasn't changed substantially since Live At Donington. Now, THAT is an essential listen.<br /><br />This one reflects their age and maturity. It's not the raw power of the past, but that's OK. It's a solid effort and IF it had been released by anyone else, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. Unfortunate recopying of an Ozzy song title (Shot In The Dark) notwithstanding.<br /><br />Rock ON.

1,6 YEARS!! Pass me that glass of wine please.....,"With this music I can honestly state that the Adele adulation/fascination train has, unfortunately, skipped the tracks. And, please don't misunderstand me, I love Adele's vocals and believe she definitely belongs to the upper echelon of female vocalists. But this offering is below the high standard she set with her other c.d.s.<br />Do we really must hear on one track to her son that she (near tears) is having a bad day. Excuse my lack of empathy, but this woman has millions of dollars and if she wants to compare bad days, she should speak to me.<br />Some of the songs here remind me of what she's done before. Thus, no new creativity, no new exciting direction and, for the most part, a lack of energy.  I am sure that if you pick and choose there might be a few tunes here that you like. However, if you're like me, you don't want to develope callouses pushing the skip button.<br />Proceed if you must, but do it with caution.

2,Overpriced and depressing,"Like many, I have Adele's previous albums. When 30 was announced, I wasn't too keen on getting it. ""Same ol', slow, depressing music,"" I thought. But, I caved. My top 8 observations, in no particular order:<br /><br />8. Music - The first time I heard the album, I was excited. In addition to the classic Adele we all love, other tracks had an upbeat bluesy feel, and moments reminiscent of Motwown. (Though, a friend commented she hated the background singers on one of the tracks.) I wish it would have been pushed further. The music producing was questionable at times -- using her child's recorded conversation was the low point of the album for me, while Sides B and D were the highlights.<br /><br />7. Vinyl Presentation - Love the album cover. The white vinyl was cool, but why in the world did the art director make the label orange-yellow? It looks like an EGG. Aesthetically doesn't jive with the rest of the album visually or conceptually. Scratchin' my head on that one.<br /><br />6. Hits - While generally the songs were solid, there were no monsters on 30. 19 had ""Chasing Pavements,"" 21 had ""Someone Like You"", 25 had ""Hello."" Tough acts for ""Easy on Me"" to follow.<br /><br />5. Track arrangement - 3 songs per side over four sides was a real BUMMER. It‚Äôs supposedly for improved quality, but I would've much preferred killing two of the worst tracks and fitting everything all on one record.<br /><br />4. Commercial - Adele already allowed one of the songs, ""Hold On,"" for use in an Amazon commercial, I think before the album came out. If you want us to take your art seriously, maybe hold off on selling it for an advertisement? (""Hold On"" is a great song, btw. If it were bad, this wouldn't even be a point of contention.)<br /><br />3. Albums - I liked ""30"" third best of all her albums. For me it goes: 21, 19, 30, 25.<br /><br />2. Price - At $40, there was nothing to speak of in the way of extras. No booklet, gatefold insert, Autorip or downloadable code...nothing. What poor value. By contrast, Coldplay's Music of the Spheres had all those things, plus BTS and Selena Gomez, for 22 bucks.<br /><br />1. Most music, I wanna hang out with at a certain point in time, depending on mood. Adele's ""30"" is more like being stuck in a 2-hour brunch with an acquaintance who's going on about her divorce. At least it felt like 2 hours. Google says the album runtime was 58 minutes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef7VIBXsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HVTKLPQ,B09HVRTMFX,AHOQVDAF6N6TEQQW5TM572JZXVQA,2021-11-30 18:28:52.957,8,True

I'm not a singer, but I'm an artist and I like to change my style and try different things.  That's how you grow.  I am surprised at the people who were upset about songs that have come from Adele's personal experiences.  Isn't experience what great songs are made of?  As they say, ""do what you know"".  I like this album and the opaque white vinyl is really pretty.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can barely read the writing on the record's labels.

I applaud her bravery for touching a subject no artist I know has and with an entire album is a brilliant thing. The most impactful art is either hated or loved.

As the set progressed, I was entranced by how Adele was singing her heart out.  There is no denying she is a POWERFUL singer.  ""Cry Your Heart Out"" is one depressed woman.  ""Oh My God"" hits a groove similar to her previous releases.  ""Can I Get It,"" Track 6, shifted my attitude about ""30.""  Her vocals flow seamlessly as she swirls in desire for a lover.  ""I Drink Wine"" moves back into therapy mode where she seems to realize alcohol is not a solution.  ""Woman Like Me"" sways softly as she sadly dismisses a lazy lover.  It takes about two minutes on ""To Be Loved"" before Adele belts her heart out, ""Let it be known that I'm trying.""  ""Love Is A Game"" closes this standard edition (deluxe has additional tracks) as Adele is a disillusioned lover.  This is a broken heart record.  It demands the emotional attention of its listeners.  It's adult.  It's not easy; but it is brilliant.  I told my daughter that if Dylan hadn't taken the title ""Blood on the Tracks"" that would have fit this release.  Adele transcends the pop singer label into an incredible artist.

5,Adele's Diary of Discontent and Hope,"Adele breaks new ground and plumbs the depths from inside her in an inspired use of her past.  The single, ""Easy On Me"", appeals to her heartbreaking divorce and other challenges - sparing any whininess.  It sets the tone for what follows.  On each of these twelve songs, Adele's singing demonstrates that she's not nodding off at the microphone.  The emotional risks she's feeling is evident in every note and there's a fine rapport between her and the musicians.  Most autobiographically moving are ""My Little Love"", ""I Drink Wine"" and ""Woman Like Me"".  With this record, Adele has brought out a touch of poetry born out of distress, if not chaos, for the first time.  But she allows herself room for self-forgiveness.

3,Great Songs by the Queen of Pop Rock...disappointing vinyl pressing - lots of pops and ticks.,"Okay, as far as the music and vocals go...it's Adele...nothing else needs said. Most of the songs are superb. Are there a couple of songs less than superb? Yes maybe a couple. Let's face it you can't hit a home run on every song, but Adele comes very close to doing just that. With that said, if you are going to release a double LP, have enough material to fill 2 LPs or at least make it a 45 rpm album with wider grooves. Wider grooves = better sound quality. 3 songs per side just means more interruptions to the listening experience with no apparent gains in quality. Also for her first release on Columbia records, you would think they would have gone the extra mile to put out a better quality product. There were a lot of scrap shavings still on the edges of the records and the edges are sharp enough to cut you (or cut through the inner sleeves) if not handled carefully. The sound quality is acceptable except for the numerous pops and ticks throughout all sides of the record, again probably caused by excess material that was not cleaned from the records properly after they were pressed (shame on the stamping plant). Even after ultrasonically cleaning both LPs before the first play, both records are VERY noisy. Fortunately I have a method of removing the pops and ticks. I just shouldn't have to on a new record.<br />So, is it worth buying Adele's newest release on vinyl? Yes, just stay clear of the white vinyl issue and opt for the black. Maybe you'll have better luck.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816UHWcINRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SBa5y6Z8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HVTKLPQ,B09HVRTMFX,AEJLPB2IZKPAKYCP2MK4AI3E6FIQ,2021-11-20 22:18:21.741,21,True

Maybe I am just too old, and musically aware, to appreciate the music they included in this movie.  What year were they intending this movie was supposed to be from?  How were the songs from such radically different years, yet it seemed suggested they were all first run songs?  Some songs hadn't actually come out yet.  Some songs had come out years earlier. And if these kids knew so much about music, how could they have never heard any of these songs years ago?  Or said: Wow there's a song that's years away from even being released?

It appeals to the 50 year old + generation as well as younger generations of teens looking for music with bands who actually play instruments and not relying on computers.

1,This is just not good.,"There have been an untold number of popular artist who released an album that was dramatically different than anything that had done before. And their fans and music critics frowned on it simply because it was so different than anything that artist has previously released. Then later, sometimes years later, people began to appreciate and even enjoy that same album when it was judged by itself and not in conjunction with what was expected.<br /><br />Sadly, this release from Adele does not fit this  formula. It's simply not good music. It's not enjoyable. She obviously needed to get some heavy feelings off her chest. And that's perfectly fine. But an artist can draw on painful emotions and still have ""good music.""<br /><br />This album will sell because this is Adele. If this were her first album, it might lead to a very short career.<br /><br />Oh, and to the sound engineer...you need to be fired.

4,"This album is brilliant, and very different.","This album is really incredible and has a different feel than Adele's other albums. To me, it has a very retro feel.  I hear a lot of songs with melodies and instrumentation that go back to the '50s and '60s. One track even features Errol Garner on the piano of a song he wrote (""All Night Parking"" that Adele added some lyrics to.  The first track, 'Strangers By Nature"" is gorgeous, and reminds me of a Burt Bacharach song, like something I'd hear on the radio or on a TV Special in the '50s or '60s.  I hear this ""Bacharach"" type of song on other tracks as well, and that is a big compliment. To be compared to Burt Bacharach, one of the greatest composers ( along with Hal David) ever, is one of the best things I can say about Adele and this album.  There are a few upbeat tracks, ""Can I Get It"", a more current sounding track, ""Cry Your Heart Out"", and ""Oh My God"".  One of the best tracks is ""My Little Love"", which is dedicated to her young son, and it includes recordings of her chatting with her son about how she is feeling during a divorce. It will make you cry. It's a beautiful song.  I love that this album has a Retro feel, and also includes some jazz elements and pop elements of the '50s and '60s.  This will probably be my favorite album of hers, or at least in the top two so far.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AGKWRF7YCX25MLQT7JWTLPT3T3BQ,2021-11-20 02:57:36.171,1,False

The problem is that they put out so much great material back in the 70's and 80's, that it's hard to NOT compare it to that.  It really falls short compared to ""The Razor's Edge"", ""Back in Black"" and ""For Those About To Rock..."".  If I want to listen to AC/DC with Brian Johnson, those are what I go for.

5,The Only Good Thing to Come out of 2020,"The Good-  These songs are tight, layered, and surprisingly melodic.  Brian Johnson sounds great here.  Somehow, he sounds better here than he did 20-30 years ago.  The album gives him more to do vocally and gives the album a freshness to it.  AC/DC of course never loses its trademark sound while expanding their range a bit.  The lyrics are the best they've written since Ballbreaker.  The mixing is much better than Rock or Bust as now you can clearly hear Brian Johnson's vocals. Angus and company are, as usual, on point with their playing.<br /><br />The Bad-  It appears they have scaled back on the guitar solos a bit.  I would have preferred some of them to a bit longer.  This is a minor gripe and it's all I got for anything negative to say about this album.<br /><br />The Deal-  This album is a great rebound from the forgettable Rock or Bust.  More importantly, a worthy tribute to the late great Malcom Young.  This year has been a train wreck with no survivors.  PWR UP is the only saving grace from this miserable year.

2,the good thing about this collection is that new generations are ...,"The true movie soundtrack albums were produced in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.  Starting in the 1990s movie producers would just select a few songs from the past (whatever was available in terms of publishing rights) and release &#34;a soundtrack album &#34; with songs that had nothing to do with the movie. This phenomenon repeats itself with this soundtrack album to some extent.  I have to admit that the producers of this compilation at least took the time to carefully select songs that were not obvious choices. So, the good thing about this collection is that new generations are going to be introduced  to true classic songs like &#34;Teenage Riot&#34; and &#34;Heroes&#34;.  Don't get me wrong, I consider the movie &#34;Perks&#34; one of the best of 2012.

Everything is balanced, and the vocals are centered as if Adele singing in your Living-room. That being said, this pressing is either pressed at GZ media or Europe and is super noisy. Even after cleaning it, it is still noisy.<br />Overall, great record, and is worth buying.

5,Best Since Razor‚Äôs Edge,"Back in the day, before I was even in my teens, I owned Highway to Hell, Back in Black, and For Those About to Rock on vinyl. Needless to say, I was a huge AC/DC fan. They lost the mojo, IMO, with a string of less than stellar albums. Then, Razor‚Äôs Edge came out in 1990 and they were BACK!  Or so I thought. Again, another string of less than stellar albums. None bad, but none great, either. So, when I heard Powerup was coming out, I was glad to hear it, but wasn‚Äôt expecting much. Let me just say, this album has FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. Like, by a mile. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop listening to this since I got it. Not a bad song on here and quite a few great ones. I find myself with a different song stuck in my head every day. I‚Äôd have to say my very favorite song is Rejection, but again, they‚Äôre all outstanding. So glad they made another album and, if this is their last, they went out strong. Highly recommended.",[],B08KGT79CH,B08KGT79CH,AGYV5KR4B2J2O4YGNSSDCG4HNNOQ,2020-11-29 03:49:58.582,1,True

3,I like about 1/2 of this album,"I started listening to Adele with the release of 19. Have enjoyed her progression as an artist and have rarely felt the need to skip songs on her albums. However, this album only has a few songs I like - the rest are either just ok, or make me cringe a little.  I understand the desire to show her emotional connection to these songs, but the audio of her crying was not what I was hoping to hear.<br /><br />For me, there just weren't as many anthem type songs on this album. It is, indeed, a more personal introspective album, but I don't think it fares as well as her other works.<br /><br />You may love it. For me, I look forward to seeing what 35 will bring us.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AG6ROZ66QWDEHNET4NMQTREVKT3Q,2022-01-08 23:02:14.579,0,True

I was excited to get this new album and add some favorites to my list, but the music turned out to be completely different. She has a beautiful voice and can really connect with an audience but this album did not do anything for me. I felt as if I was listening to someone else like Amy Winehouse and that I couldn‚Äôt decipher a particular sound that made me recognize Adele. The music is different and not what I expected. It‚Äôs not bad, just not for me and definitely not what I was expecting. One song in particular that I enjoyed was All night Parking (and of course Easy on me).

I'd suggest it as an awesome gift for anyone, especially yourself.<br />C'mon it's Adele!",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AEJUIEALVX3HTW2JKF7RX42M2TQA,2022-01-07 22:43:16.943,0,True
2,Not the same Adele quality to which we're accostomed and not for every Adele fan for sure.,"If you are reading the reviews of ""30"" I imagine you are familiar with Adele and most likely her ""21"" and ""25"" releases. They were both, well, simply phenomenal recordings. On 25, in particular, almost every song could stand on its own merit and had top 10 potential. The songwriting and the singing were spectacular in my book. And, while not audiophile quality by any stretch, the recording was pretty good too.  After 5 years, she released this album, which as you can read in many reviews here and elsewhere, has not been met with nearly as much enthusiasm, and I can certainly see why and don't disagree.<br /><br />Many musicians, once they've reached a level of critical success and, dare I say, fame and fortune, will deviate from what made them that way in order to pursue their artistic interest and creativity. I don't know if that is the case here, as she doesn't seem to have written these songs for the most part. But it is certainly a departure from what made 21 and especially 25 tremendous commercial successes.  Lyrically I expect these offerings will find great acclaim from the emo crowd perhaps. And, Adele being the musical powerehouse that she is, may have just created a whole new genre called Blues Pop, or something of that ilk. It's got to be hard to have so much talent, fame and money at such a young age, so when troubles in life that are common to most of us come your way,  it feels like the world is imploding around you. The fact is that emotionally healthy individuals find ways to deal with the imperfect people, lives and world in which we all  exist. This album must be her way of dealing with it. It worked for the great blues artists of the 20th century, and certainly for the Country and Western genre artists as well. Pretty much every one of these songs is her lamenting failed love and life in some form or fashion and one can't help feeling down after listening to them. At least I couldn't. There is no message in these songs that I particularly enjoy or even want to hear, let alone listen to over and over like I do 21 and 25. On My Little Love, for example, she is singing to her child, who presumably is the one singing with her as well. She speak-sings to them about how depressed she is, hard her life is and that she is hung over really badly. Ugh, I pity the child if she is really like this.<br /><br />Stylistically, well it is all over the place too, although that's not always a bad thing. Artists mature, evolve and find ways to keep their material innovative, fresh and interesting. But here, well, it fails to accomplish any of that for me. Some songs sound like something out of the 1940's or 1950's  (Strangers by Nature), others somewhat modern, like her signature pop soul style, and others, well I'm not sure what you would call it. Sometimes her voice sounds forced and anything but engaging on several songs. There are some weird, and even unpleasant soul ding back up vocals (Cry Your Heart Out for example) that make the songs ones that will always earn a skip when, or if, I listen to the CD again. Yet as varied as the styles are, it kind of all sounds kinda the same too, which us odd.<br /><br />Sonically, it is not a particularly good recording. It probably sounds ok with in ear monitors/ear buds, and is perhaps made better with binaural or spatial audio, but on a decent stereo system it falls really flat. Imaging is indistinct, clarity is dull, dynamics are blunted. The recording is lackluster, sounding very compressed like an under-engineered pop effort that could have been made in a mediocre Y**Tub* producer‚Äôs living room. There is no sparkle, foot tapping, hand raising ooohing and aaahhhing over the sonics for me. It just sounds poor on my home stereo. No big loss though,  as it turns out.<br /><br />So what is left to be said? Well, evidently Adele wanted to tell the world how miserable she is over her failed relationship(s), family struggles and overall miserable state of being. If so, she accomplished it in spades. I've listened to it four times through, once even with a musician friend who wouldn't even finish the CD with me.<br />However, there are a couple of good songs  thankfully. Easy On Me and Woman Like Me both are good enough for me to add a second star to my overall rating, for me at least. But, they aren't good enough for me to want to listen to the entire work again, sadly.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if this album stands the test of time or be a flop. No artist gets it right every time and I will certainly grant her some grace by waiting another block of time to see if she overcomes this morose outlook on life to come up with another musically and lyrically decent, or even great, album. I'll be setting this one aside to collect dust in the meantime. Obviously I'm just not the target audience she had in mind with this effort like I may have been for her previous releases, and that's fine. I'm just throwing out my thoughts for others to consider before subjecting themselves to these songs. You may want to borrow or stream this one before purchasing. Sorry Adele, this one just doesn't do it for me. Hopefully your next one will.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AEUMLQUYXYTCQNX7E6J6RVM4WJ5Q,2021-11-30 21:47:17.714,7,True

3,"A fun album, no duds, no standouts","This album is a solid 41 minutes of music. The production is okay, but nothing like Back in Black or even Razors Edge. The mix doesnt have a kick to it and Johnson's vocals get raised or dropped in the mix depending on the song. The songs are even. Unlike Black Ice that had strong standouts like Rock N Roll Train or War Machine versus total missus like Big Jack, this album feels steady. That's a good thing and a bad thing at the same type.<br /><br />The songs do offer a decent variety but some repeats.<br /><br />Realize has a tamer Thunderstruck vibe. A chanting background  with a decent hook.<br />Rejection is a good one that has that Black Ice feel to it. I'd swear this one is from that album<br />Shot In The Dark has a nice kick to it. Short and fast with some chanting to it.<br />Through The Mists of Time is different from the rest of the album I like the lyrics and the rhythm here. Problem the biggest departure from the norm.<br />Kick You When You're Down is another different one. It has that start-stop to the beat like something you might find on Highway To Hell. I like this one as well.<br />Witch's Spell is a tight rocker.<br />Demon Fire is a great song but it's Caught With Your Pants Down basically with new lyrics. I like the updated version here.<br />Wild Reputation is a bluesy tune with a decent Angus cut.<br />No Man's Land is even more bluesy and it works really here. Another favorite of mine. It has Malcolm all over it.<br />Systems Down should have been the album finisher. It builds steam and is a good track.<br />Money Shot is not what you might think. It's not filler, it's not crude and it features my favorite Angus solo on the album.<br />Code Red is another excellent track. The second side is very, very solid and really the order can be debated but this is a good album ending.<br /><br />The final three songs remind me of the George Young (and Vanda) days where the guitars stand out above everything else. Like something like Show Business or another track from before Let There Be Rock.<br /><br />Is this album among the best? Of course not. It compares to Ballbreaker, Stiff Upper Lip, Black Ice and Rock Or Bust. The hard riffs found on Flick of the Switch or Fly On The Wall (other less than favorable albums) are not present but the album isnt as slow as Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />The hardest part about the album is there are only a handful of total minutes where Angus cuts loose and that's the main reason to listen to the album.<br /><br />I can see this album sitting above Stiff Upper Lip, Rock or Bust and maybe even with Black Ice but below Razors Edge.

3,Power Up and Punch The Clock - Nothing Memorable Here,"By their own admission, AC-DC has achieved decades of worldwide success by repeating the same musical formula over and over again.  In fact, their only commercial failures have been those albums where they ventured outside the formula, and the fanbase rejected it (Fly On The Wall, Ballbreaker, Stiff Upper Lip).  While the new album Power Up was recorded as a deserving tribute to Malcolm Young, the reality is these tracks are well produced, well performed but generic and unmemorable.

5,Adele Matures and Experience Heartbreak at 30,"REVIEW OF ADELE'S ""30.""<br /><br />You know folks. I'm a throwback to the 60s, 70s, and 80s. As the years go by I become more disenchanted with what modern music has become, or where it's going.<br /><br />However, only a few modern artists stands out to me and Adele tops that list.<br /><br />For the last decade Adele's music could be heard on my digital streaming devices at home or in my ears via Amazon Music or Tidal.<br /><br />The amount of blockbuster hits that Adele has under her belt is staggering for an artist who hasn't even reached 30...until recently when she actually hit the big 3 0.<br /><br />Adele herself is a throwback..well kind of. A case can be made for her to be the Barbara Streisand and Celine Dion of her generation.<br /><br />So I was skeptical reading all of the reviews of her new studio album which was released today. The critics praised this album as her best ever...Rolling Stone music journalist Rob Sheffield called 30 Adele's ""toughest, most powerful album yet"" with the best vocal performances of her career, and praised its ""deft"" production by her collaborators. Neil McCormick, in his review for The Daily Telegraph, hailed 30 as her strongest record yet, containing ""powerhouse"" songs with ""intense"" emotions and ""bravura"" performances. Emma Swann of DIY described the album as ""raw and uncompromising"", matching cinematic music with lyrics on ""the pain, the self-flagellation, the hope, the acceptance of things gone horribly wrong.""<br /><br />I gave the album a whirl this morning and it quintessential Adele..but with a kick. Adele doesn't change her formula of being the queen of heartbreak songs but embraces it. In a world for artists to keep changing their formula to stay on top, Adele doesn't go that route.<br /><br />Instead, Adele shows maturity and reflection on life in an album that places her emotions center stage, and in your face . There is nothing pretentious or sugar coated on these songs. It's a woman spilling her sorrows out in her artistic craft.<br /><br />30 has everything you want from Adele...anger, sadness, hopelessness, being pensive and being afraid of change.<br /><br />I wouldn't say 30 is her best album, but I will say that the songs are definitely her most personal and can appeal to anyone who is going through traumatic heartbreak or who has experienced loss in his or her lifetime.<br /><br />Adele and her buttery voice clearly shines on 30. For us old timers,, it's good to see that Adele can write songs that appeals to multi generational listeners, instead of appealing to a more marketable group of the youth of today.<br /><br />In conclusion,  Adele 30 is a snapshot into an artist's real life, eschewing the glamor of being a superstar. Adele proves that her voice and the topics she sings about are timeless and will be remembered in years to come as being classics like Streisand or Dion.",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AHTFE4GQI2J2FZLNFBRTCAMMQGDQ,2021-11-19 15:22:55.150,4,False

Individual tracks, sure, like Thunderstruck, or For those About To Rock, but all of the music tends to just blur as one big offering.

5,throwback to 19,"Adele told James Corden that ""25"" would be her last album named after her age because she ""believes in trilogies,"" so I am glad she did not hold herself to that.

And on ""30"" this new kind of heartbreak, of a real future lost feels like a completion of the gains and losses of ""19."" The music itself gives me such throwbacks to that first album, bringing on such nostalgia as to tear your heart in two between who you were and whom you then thought you could/would become (and probably for most, some things we did and some things we didn't). I hope she never stops naming albums after her age‚Äîgive us that ""77"" Corden joked about. :D",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AFBGEK65K3XCZNSSKBLYM4IR762Q,2021-12-12 23:55:26.945,0,False

5,"Not as radio-friendly, but possibly her most impressive album","30 isn't as full of simple radio-friendly ballads and barn-burners as 21 and, to a lesser extent, 19 and 25; I imagine this is the main reason for the fairly high percentage of one-star reviews here. But I personally found this to be Adele's most musically diverse, vocally impressive album to date. The subject matter is more complicated, the lyrics are more personal, and the moments of musical experimentation are more abundant than in her earlier efforts. But this is a pro rather than a con in my variety-loving mind, and Adele has never sounded better - certainly a relief given her significant weight loss and history of vocal problems. Would highly recommend this album.<br /><br />Personal favorites: ""Easy on Me"", ""Oh My God"", ""Can I Get It"", ""I Drink Wine""<br /><br />Absolute favorite: ""To Be Loved"" (gutted me emotionally and probably her most impressive vocal performance to date)",[],B09HVRTMFX,B09HVRTMFX,AFZ4TG4NZRE3B3NDT2DEIMKUXENA,2021-11-26 01:55:11.158,5,True

Adele‚Äôs extended absence and some of the different musical directions taken on 30 have apparently left at least a few fans ‚Äì rumour has it -- underwhelmed.  A cardinal rule of successful songwriting is the provision of lyrics with enough gauzy edges that most everyone hearing the song can relate to it in some way.  Not Adele ‚Äì 30 is her own private catharsis around her divorce ‚Äì including a confessional conversation with her young son, complete with sobs and sniffles (‚ÄúMy Little Love‚Äù).

I don't think this album will hit the masses like 21 and 25, which is fine, so be it. I personally love 19 and 30. The 20s are so overrated. Ha! Adele's phase reminds me of George Michael and Annie Lennox where having had their hits and fame, they deliver their more quiet, introspective album ""Older,"" and ""Bare,"" respectively. Adele, still being the youngest of the three at only 30. Having recently gone through an emotionally, draining divorce myself, with three kids, I can relate to this album very much. This album is very healing. ""My Little Love,"" ""Clean Heart,"" heart-wrenching for the better. The album has such maturity and soul. Amazing. Love the old 60s, 70s soulful vibe on the album.

The mastering is good and the one song where Adele sings practically acapella with just a piano sounds amazing, but it is just too noisy for my taste. I am also very disappointed in most of the album because she is trying to do something different and it just doesn't work. One of the songs sounded like she had the chipmunks on the track and I thought it was a bad recording. I am sorry to say it is going back.

1,"Horrible Quality, Bad Songs","I was so excited to purchase this record because I love Adele's music, but I was extremely disappointed for multiple reasons:<br /><br />First of all, right out of the box, there were unremovable marks all over the record that caused several skips and repeated sections, making the vinyl extremely annoying to play. There were also inconsistencies in the plastic edges of the vinyls that looked extremely cheaply made and unprofessional.<br /><br />I was also extremely disappointed with Adele's album itself. To put it plainly, the music (except for Easy On Me) is absolute garbage. She recorded herself talking and saying things like ""mummy's had a rough day"" or ""tell me you love me"" throughout her songs. I don't want to listen to that haha.<br /><br />Most of the other songs are extremely muffled by loud instrumentals that lack any real melody. Her old songs used to have actual melodies, but these songs have hardly any actual structure. They're just bad.<br /><br />The only song I like is Easy On Me. Maybe I'll try to find a 45 of that song made by a DIFFERENT company. I'm returning this crap.",[],B09HVTKLPQ,B09HVRTMFX,AECNW65UBBIHQQG7ZIUI6FQVHURA,2022-01-04 19:31:36.277,2,True

2,Not up to the standard we have all come to expect.,"So we all waited with restless anticipation for Adele's next album. A teaser came out with release of ""Easy on Me"" and excitement grew. Great song that stands up to anything on her last two offereings. Then I got the CD and popped in the stereo. WTF?<br /><br />My first impression was awful.  I read several comments from others who agreed. I gave it one more listen. Still the same impressions.  Then Rolling Stone came out with a glorious review. WTF. Did I miss something? So I sat down and listened, intently to the dozen songs again. For the third (and last time). OMG it's horrible.  Here is my review:<br /><br />STRANGERS BY NATURE:  A funeral dirge that sounds more like a Christmas Carol than an upbeat pop song.  Grade:  C<br /><br />EASY ON ME: Great song, up to the quality of her previous offerings. Grade: A<br /><br />MY LITTLE LOVE: Written for her son Angelo who appears on the track at the end asking mommy why she be so sad. Sounds more like a 911 call to a suicide line than a song.  Grade: C-<br /><br />CRY YOUR HEART OUT: I wanted to, listening to this song. She moans through several verses interrupted by a weird electronically altered chorus bringing her grade down from an ""album filler"" B- to  a C.<br /><br />OH MY GOD:  That's the name of the song, and my reaction as well. OMG!  Is this an Adele song or an R&B (Retch & Barf) track? ""Hmm hmm yeah,"" more like Uh...uh...no. Something from the 1950's piano lounge singers.<br /><br />CAN I GET IT :Nice beginning, good beat, things are looking up. Grade: B+<br /><br />I DRINK WINE:  No kidding. Another slow dirge. Where's the fire in this rain? And the ending....WTF spoken word. Piano Lounge Lizard again. Grade: B-<br /><br />ALL NIGHT PARKING:  Lizard is gettng tired,  and so am I having to listen to this drivel.  On life support . Grade: C<br /><br />WOMAN LIKE ME:  BORRRRRING. Lounge lizard just died.<br /><br />HOLD ON: So quiet sounds like the neighbor in the house next door singing...drunk.  Someone needs a little Xanax.<br /><br />TO BE LOVED: God no! Not another funeral dirge?!  C-<br /><br />LOVE IS A GAME: Strings! OMG NO!  Has she risen to the point the sychophants around her are building her up at the expense of good music?

5,A Masterpiece!,"This album hit me at age 55, like Back in Black hit me at age 15. When I 1st heard it I thought it was very, very good. When I heard it a 2nd time I thought it was Great! When I heard it for a 3rd time I thought it was a Masterpiece! The difference with albums like this and the run of the mill stuff, is that you immediately like a few of the catchy song, but the other songs never catch on; but on a great album such as this they all quickly grow on you and become favorites in their own way.  For me, I immediately liked Realize, Shot In the Dark, Kick You When You're Down, Demon Fire, Wild Reputation and Money Shot.  I liked all of the tracks but thought Rejection, and No Man's Land and Through the Mist of Time were the weakest tracks but now they are my current favorites.  And I have to say Through the Mist of Time is monumental and it is hard for me to not shed a tear or two thinking about Malcolm Young and all this band has been through and what they stand for!  I am not an audio technician but to my ears the sound on this album is phenomenal.  Brians voice is the best it has ever sounded, at least since Back in Black, and love the songs where he goes lower range, and Cliff, Phil, Stevie and of course Angus' playing is extraordinary and super tight. The really crazy thing about this album is that all the songs come across equally well on everything from my cell phone speakers, to the laptop speakers, to my car speakers, to my booming 9 x 190 watt home sound system. The sound is in a word ""explosive"", which it very well should be with an AC/DC album of this caliber!  I have the album on CD, deluxe CD,  yellow vinyl, black vinyl and loaded on every piece of digital audio equipment I own. 2020 just got a lot better.

5,The Modern Day Back In Black,"AC/DC has had a rough couple of years after the release of Rock or Bust. Brian's hearing loss, Phil's legal trouble and Cliff's departure it wasn't looking good for the group.  Then the unthinkable happened with the loss of Malcolm. I thought that was it for the group. Then in 2020 the unthinkable happened; the remaining group came back to create a modern day Back in Black. This album is a wonderful tribute to Malcolm. This isn't just a good album, this is a masterpiece! Every song is catchy and has you humming or singing along.  Stand outs for me are Realize, Rejection, Shot in the Dark, Kick You When You're Down, Demon Fire, Wild Reputation, Systems Down, Money Shot and Code Red.

From the Rocky Horror Picture Show to David Bowie (probably his best song never played - and I kept yelling ""Harmione, it's Bowie"") even to Air Supply, this movie is spot on to what kids (I) gravitated to growing up.  And finding 'misfit' friends who truly care about you and allow you to be yourself...<br /><br />If you were this type of kid 'strange, real'.. you will love this soundtrack.  I would rank it as good as 'Grosse Point Blank' and better than 'Take Me Home Tonight' movie soundtracks for real 80s music.<br /><br />If you are a younger person and am interested in this type of music also consider Duran Duran, Eurythmics, and Violent Femmes.  Great bands that spurned from punk and the second British music invasion.",[],B008KL4KB6,B008KL4KB6,AGTK3WEQLECSIU6K6QAWKEAT3UYA,2013-03-23 01:02:27.000,1,False

4,Fun soundtrack,"I decided to get this album after viewing this movie with my kid because it reminded me of my college days in the late 80's.  Some of the songs are reminiscent of those days.
